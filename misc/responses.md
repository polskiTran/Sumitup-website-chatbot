An emerging trend in design is the significant overhaul of operating system interfaces, with a strong emphasis on a more modern and slick appearance, often borrowing elements from other platforms. Apple, for instance, is planning a major design refresh for all its operating systems, codenamed "Solarium," which will be its most substantial redesign since iOS 7 in 2013 and macOS Big Sur in 2020. This update is inspired by visionOS and will feature glass-like elements, transparency, and redesigned icons and interface components.

In parallel, the integration of AI into design workflows is becoming increasingly prominent. This includes new frameworks that allow developers to leverage on-device large language models for AI-powered features that prioritize privacy and offline functionality. Furthermore, AI is beginning to shift the focus of UX design from traditional visual interfaces to AI-first systems, where conversational and predictive AI handle user interactions. This trend necessitates UX professionals to adapt their skills to prompt engineering and AI analytics, viewing AI as a collaborative partner.

Other notable trends include a growing focus on design systems with an emphasis on strategic, iterative rollouts rather than complete redesigns, and the importance of building a personal brand as a designer in a competitive job market.
