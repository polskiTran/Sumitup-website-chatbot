An emerging trend in design is the significant overhaul of operating system interfaces, with a strong emphasis on a more modern and slick appearance, often borrowing elements from other platforms. Apple, for instance, is planning a major design refresh for all its operating systems, codenamed "Solarium," which will be its most substantial redesign since iOS 7 in 2013 and macOS Big Sur in 2020. This update is inspired by visionOS and will feature glass-like elements, transparency, and redesigned icons and interface components.

In parallel, the integration of AI into design workflows is becoming increasingly prominent. This includes new frameworks that allow developers to leverage on-device large language models for AI-powered features that prioritize privacy and offline functionality. Furthermore, AI is beginning to shift the focus of UX design from traditional visual interfaces to AI-first systems, where conversational and predictive AI handle user interactions. This trend necessitates UX professionals to adapt their skills to prompt engineering and AI analytics, viewing AI as a collaborative partner.

Other notable trends include a growing focus on design systems with an emphasis on strategic, iterative rollouts rather than complete redesigns, and the importance of building a personal brand as a designer in a competitive job market.

**2. Superposition Meets Production—A Guide for AI Engineers**
_Date:_ July 17, 2025
_Key Finding:_ This newsletter delves into the current landscape and future prospects of quantum computing for AI applications, featuring insights from DeepMind veteran Jennifer Prendki. It highlights that while universal quantum computers are still some years away, specific quantum applications for machine learning are emerging today, particularly in recommendation systems, financial applications (e.g., fraud detection), and pharmaceuticals. A significant challenge is the lack of a mature "QMLOps" software layer, as the quantum computing stack is fragmented and primitive compared to classical ML infrastructure. The "no-cloning theorem" fundamentally alters data operations in quantum environments, requiring a shift to on-demand regeneration of quantum states rather than traditional backups or reproducibility. The newsletter also discusses how quantum computing enables new paradigms like Topological Data Analysis and emphasizes the need for "bridge talent" in engineering rather than deep quantum physics expertise for practitioners.
