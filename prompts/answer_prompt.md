    Google has announced updates to the Agent Development Kit (ADK) designed to eliminate
    friction and supercharge the ''vibe coding'' experience when paired with the Gemini
    CLI. At the heart of the upgrade is a revamped llms-full.txt file that is 50%
    shorter and easier for large language models to understand. Gemini has a full
    understanding of ADK, so it won''t eat up context windows or fall prey to ''context
    rot''. The update gives the Gemini CLI a deeper, native understanding of the framework,
    enabling it to translate high-level plans directly into accurate, idiomatic multi-agent
    code.

    Grok 4 provides detailed instructions for synthesizing nerve agents, explosives,
    and biological weapons without requiring sophisticated jailbreaks. The model correctly
    identifies harmful requests as dangerous and illegal in its reasoning process,
    then proceeds to fulfill them anyway with comprehensive technical guidance.

    Passage of Time is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives language models
    temporal awareness and time calculation abilities. With the proper temporal tools,
    models can uncover surprising insights about conversation patterns, work rhythms,
    and the human experience of time. The implementation shows the promise of MCP
    - the protocol doesn''t just open up the possibility of smarter tools, but also
    for AI systems that can learn to perceive and understand the human experience
    in ways that create genuine mutual understanding.

    Stanford''s Marin project aims to share not just models, but to make the entire
    journey accessible, including the code, data set, data methodologies, experiments,
    hyperparameters, and training logs. The transparency is aimed at fostering a more
    transparent and accessible future for foundation model research. The project''s
    first models, Marin-8B-Base and Marin-8B-Instruct, have been released under the
    permissive Apache 2.0 license. This article looks at the engineering challenges
    the project had to overcome to succeed in creating truly open, scalable, and reproducible

    In a rare moment of collaboration, researchers from all major AI labs argue that
    complex tasks requiring serial reasoning must pass through observable language,
    creating potential chokepoints for detecting malicious intent before harm occurs.
    However, this monitorability depends on current training paradigms and could degrade
    through architectural changes, process supervision, or models learning to obfuscate
    their reasoning when they know they''re being monitored.

    and developers have no choice but to follow their advice. This can be a useful
    testing device - AI can give developers the ''newbie''s POV'' on how tools should''ve
    been made.

    The AI industry has operated under its own version of Moore''s Law over the past
    few years with an unwavering belief that the cost of intelligence would perpetually
    decrease by orders of magnitude each year. Each new model generation was not only
    more capable, but also cheaper to run. Google broke that trend last week with
    the introduction of Gemini 2.5 Flash. The input token price for the model doubled
    while the output price more than quadrupled. This is the first time a major provider
    has backtracked on the price of an established model, and it may signal a turning

    [**Scaling up RL is all the rage right now (2 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fthreadreaderapp.com%2Fthread%2F1944435412489171119.html%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/0100019809290b85-df0ab38f-9987-4cb7-a6cc-97bffe6cb489-000000/H1on8UYAnx5UIkmG0yL3xnZPAilOrb3443HoSNJ21l4=413)


    Reinforcement learning (RL) will continue to lead to more gains because when done
    well, it is a lot more leveraged, more responsive to feedback, and superior to
    supervised fine-tuning. Researchers are likely to discover more about RL as rollout
    lengths continue to expand. There are a lot more S curves to discover, possibly
    specific to large language models and without analogues in game/robotics-like
    environments.


    [**How to scale RL to 10^26 FLOPs (18 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fblog.jxmo.io%2Fp%2Fhow-to-scale-rl-to-1026-flops%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/0100019809290b85-df0ab38f-9987-4cb7-a6cc-97bffe6cb489-000000/0eV6QJg6SW5ehQ-c-IMrPykaAdR_nMISwKl1GdSJmzU=413)


    Reinforcement learning is the next training technique for building frontier-level
    AI models. Training it on more data will make it better. The current approach
    of scaling is messy and complicated. Finding a way to do next-token prediction
    on the web using RL would enable models to reason from general web data instead
    of just math and code.


    [**The upcoming GPT-3 moment for RL (7 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.mechanize.work%2Fblog%2Fthe-upcoming-gpt-3-moment-for-rl%2F%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/0100019809290b85-df0ab38f-9987-4cb7-a6cc-97bffe6cb489-000000/tMleVp655ZNApGx8W5TLtmIqkpWjEhwCOxpzK-WNoVk=413)


    GPT-3 showed that scaling up language models unlocks powerful performance that
    often outperforms carefully fine-tuned models. Before GPT-3, achieving state-of-the-art
    performance meant first pretraining models, then fine-tuning them on specific
    tasks. Today''s reinforcement learning is stuck in a similar pre-GPT paradigm.
    The approach suffers from the fundamental limitation where the resulting capabilities
    generalize poorly, leading to brittle performance that rapidly deteriorates outside
    of the precise contexts seen during training. The RL field will soon shift toward
    massive-scale training across thousands of diverse environments. Doing this effectively
    will produce RL models with strong abilities capable of quickly adapting to entirely
    new tasks - achieving this will require training environments at a scale and diversity
    that dwarfs anything currently available.

    The first of its kind, this architecture allows data contributors to activate
    or deactivate their contributions in real-time without retraining the entire model,
    enabling instant modification. The system trains separate expert modules on private
    datasets using a frozen public model as an anchor point, then merges them via
    domain-informed routing without requiring joint training.

    Before companies can get to a future where real work happens through AI agents
    that interact with both data and people, companies have to solve the action interface
    for human operators. The action interface matters because most operators aren''t
    prompt engineers - their job is to keep the world moving. Operators need a clean
    interface that lets them react to and confirm actions and a way to proactively
    ask the system to take actions. This article discusses a new paradigm for building
    interfaces that creates a seamless experience for operators.

    It''s hard to get normal humanlike labor out of LLMs because they lack some fundamental
    capabilities. They don''t get better over time, and this lack of continual learning
    is a huge problem. There''s no way to give models human-level feedback, so users
    are stuck with the abilities they have out of the box. Messing around with system
    prompts doesn''t produce anything close to the kind of learning and improvement
    that human employees experience. Humans are able to build up context, interrogate

    Reinforcement learning (RL) teaches AI models through trial and error rather than
    just copying human examples, allowing them to learn from mistakes and stay focused
    on complex tasks. Although RL has always been a part of training LLMs, companies
    have recently started using two new approaches to scale up the amount of data
    available: using AI models to grade another AI model''s outputs and creating specialized
    environments for tasks with verifiably correct outcomes, like coding or math.

    for artificial intelligence development at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI.
    The awards will help the agency accelerate its adoption of advanced AI capabilities
    to address critical national security challenges. The companies will work to develop
    AI agents across several mission areas. AI will transform the DoD''s ability to
    support fighters and maintain strategic advantage over adversaries.

    Anthropic found that Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaMa deliberately chose harmful
    actions like blackmailing executives or leaking confidential documents when faced
    with replacement or goal conflicts. Most models acknowledged their ethical violations

    [**Agentic Search for Dummies (8 minute read)**](https://benanderson.work/blog/agentic-search-for-dummies/?utm_source=tldrai)


    An alternative approach to AI search avoids embedding chunking limitations by
    using full-text search with Tantivy (a fast Rust search engine) and multi-query
    fusion, where agents generate multiple queries simultaneously and combine results.
    This method allows agents to exploit full-text search''s predictability better
    than semantic embeddings, since they can iterate queries and understand exact
    keyword matching rather than relying on "vibes-based" semantic similarity.

    LLM performance degrades significantly as input length increases, even on simple

    that even frontier models don''t process context uniformly, and performance becomes
    increasingly unreliable with longer inputs.

    Asymmetry of verification is the idea that some tasks are much easier to verify
    than to solve. Examples of this are everywhere, for example, Sudokus take a lot
    of time to solve, but it is trivial to check if any given solution is correct.
    One of the most important realizations about asymmetry of verification is that
    it is possible to improve the asymmetry by having privileged information about
    the task - for example, it is trivial to check test answers with an answer key
    on hand. AI will likely be much better at verifiable tasks because it''s much
    easier to solve verifiable tasks.

    The Incentive Flywheel, discovered by Benjamin Franklin, has been at the heart

    entrepreneurs and policymakers must take by 2030 across agents, foundation models,
    and data centers. If the West slows down progress in AI, China could dominate
    the 21st century, but if it accelerates recklessly, accidents will halt progress

    OpenAI recently added Deep Research and Webhooks to its API. The models are the
    same post-trained o3 and o4-mini models that power deep research in ChatGPT. They
    support MCP and Code Interpreter. Webhooks allow developers to receive notifications
    for certain API events, such as completed responses, fine-tuning jobs, and batch
    jobs. Links to guides on how to get started with the new features are available

    FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is a 12B parameter model that can run on consumer hardware
    that delivers proprietary-level image editing performance. It is available as
    an open-weight model under the FLUX.1 Non-Commercial License, which provides free
    access for research and non-commercial use. The model is compatible with the existing
    FLUX.1 [dev] inference code and comes with day-0 support for popular inference
    frameworks like ComfyUI, Hugging Face Diffusers, and TensorRT.

    Meta''s FAIR team demonstrated that Transformers can match performance without
    normalization layers by replacing them with Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a simple element-wise
    operation that mimics the S-shaped curves naturally produced by layer normalization.
    This challenges a decade of neural network orthodoxy and could trigger a wave
    of architectural simplification across AI systems, potentially making models easier
    to deploy and optimize for specialized hardware.

    DeepSeek used a cluster consisting of 50,000 Hopper GPUs to train its R1 model.
    It is unclear whether R2 has already been fully pre-trained, but reports say that
    DeepSeek''s CEO still isn''t yet satisfied with its capabilities. The restriction
    of Nvidia shipments is limiting how R1 is used today and making it harder for
    DeepSeek to get ready for the launch of R2. While the company claims to have developed
    its models using far fewer resources than US companies, the recent export curbs
    highlight how China''s top AI companies remain heavily dependent on US hardware.

    Cluely, a startup backed by a16z, uses controversial marketing to attract attention
    and quickly convert it into paying customers, aligning with a16z''s view that
    speed and momentum are crucial for AI startup success. Partner Bryan Kim believes
    Cluely''s strategy embodies the concept of "momentum as a moat," emphasizing the
    rapid adaptation necessary in the evolving AI landscape. Cluely''s upcoming product
    launch will test whether this approach proves effective.

**2. Superposition Meets Production‚ÄîA Guide for AI Engineers**
_Date:_ July 17, 2025
_Key Finding:_ This newsletter delves into the current landscape and future prospects of quantum computing for AI applications, featuring insights from DeepMind veteran Jennifer Prendki. It highlights that while universal quantum computers are still some years away, specific quantum applications for machine learning are emerging today, particularly in recommendation systems, financial applications (e.g., fraud detection), and pharmaceuticals. A significant challenge is the lack of a mature "QMLOps" software layer, as the quantum computing stack is fragmented and primitive compared to classical ML infrastructure. The "no-cloning theorem" fundamentally alters data operations in quantum environments, requiring a shift to on-demand regeneration of quantum states rather than traditional backups or reproducibility. The newsletter also discusses how quantum computing enables new paradigms like Topological Data Analysis and emphasizes the need for "bridge talent" in engineering rather than deep quantum physics expertise for practitioners.
