    \ and do tasks for you](https://substack.com/redirect/347711bf-44d2-4960-9d93-5783f6a3f0c9?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nOpenAI has introduced a new AI tool, ChatGPT Agent, which can perform complex,\
    \ multi-step tasks on a user's behalf using its own \"virtual computer\". The\
    \ tool, powered by a new model developed specifically for the product, can perform\
    \ tasks such as briefing a user on upcoming meetings, planning and purchasing\
    \ ingredients for a meal, and creating a slide deck based on its analysis of competing\
    \ companies.\n\nThe model behind ChatGPT Agent was trained on complex tasks that\
    \ require multiple tools, like a text browser, visual browser, and terminal where\
    \ users can import their own data, via reinforcement learning. The tool combines\
    \ the capabilities of Operator and Deep Research, two of OpenAI's existing AI\
    \ tools.\n\nThe tool is designed to perform tasks in the background, allowing\
    \ users to return to it later. Before performing any irreversible actions, such\
    \ as sending an email or making a booking, the tool asks for user permission.\
    \ OpenAI has also activated safeguards for \"high biological and chemical capabilities\"\
    \ due to the increased capabilities of the model behind the tool.\n\nThe tool\
    \ is being rolled out to Pro, Plus, and Team users, with availability for ChatGPT\
    \ Enterprise and Education users expected later this summer.\n\n#### [Google and\

    \nGoogle DeepMind's artificial intelligence system has achieved a \"gold medal\"\
    \ status in the annual International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious math\
    \ competition for high school students. This is the first time an AI has reached\
    \ this level of success, solving five out of the six problems at the 2025 competition\
    \ held in Australia. This achievement is indicative of the ongoing improvements\
    \ in AI systems by leading companies in areas such as math, science, and computer\
    \ coding. Such technology could potentially expedite research in mathematics and\
    \ science and streamline the work of experienced computer programmers.\n\nIn related\
    \ news, just two days before Google's announcement, an OpenAI researcher claimed\
    \ that their startup had developed technology that achieved a similar score on\
    \ this year's Olympiad questions, although it did not officially participate in\
    \ the competition. This suggests a growing trend of AI systems being capable of\
    \ high-level problem-solving in mathematical and scientific domains, which could\
    \ have significant implications for future research and development in these fields.\n\

    \n[Ben Lorica 罗瑞卡](https://substack.com/@gradientflow)\n\nJul 24\n\n# **Compound\
    \ Interest: AI's Invisible Impact on Productivity and Jobs**\n\nI've learned to\
    \ tune out the \"Are we there yet?\" chorus that follows every AI model release.\
    \ While Twitter debates rage about [AGI](https://substack.com/redirect/eb4f0c77-60ed-4130-9a2c-98fefdce726f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ timelines, something more interesting is happening in the trenches: current\
    \ foundation models are quietly revolutionizing how [knowledge work](https://substack.com/redirect/602e3f37-e85e-4665-9d5a-1b2ebbb37f8f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ gets done.\n\nMy own workflow tells the story. Eighteen months ago, I wrote\
    \ code line by line and researched topics through traditional search. Today, Claude\
    \ and Gemini are my coding partners, while ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok serve as\
    \ research assistants. I've even created a few NotebookLM instances, including\
    \ a \"Home Manual\" that knows more about my appliances than I do. As these models\
    \ improve their reasoning and tool integration, my productivity gains are compounding—and\
    \ I'm far from alone in this experience.\n\nThis practical adoption matters more\
    \ than theoretical milestones. China's AI strategy succeeds precisely because\
    \ it [prioritizes deployment and diffusion](https://substack.com/redirect/dba40109-6a94-4992-a7cd-822433465c58?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8).\
    \ The real story isn't whether machines can think like humans, but how they're\
    \ already reshaping human work patterns. The research backs this up: we're witnessing\
    \ the early stages of a productivity transformation that will define the next\
    \ decade.\n\n#### The Coding Revolution in Numbers\n\nA recent [study that analyzed\
    \ 80 million GitHub commits](https://substack.com/redirect/ca166610-0b82-4b18-ae4c-b4b7e3b2676d?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ provides a stunning look at how deeply AI has penetrated software development.\
    \ Researchers found that AI tools now generate roughly one-third of all Python\
    \ functions written by U.S.-based programmers. The geographic disparities are\
    \ striking: while the U.S. reached a 30% adoption rate by late 2024, China and\
    \ Russia lagged at 12% and 15%, respectively.\n\nWhat's most telling is the demographic\
    \ split. Newer programmers are adopting AI tools at a 41% rate, compared to just\
    \ 28% for experienced developers. Just as interesting, AI-assisted devs experiment\
    \ with unfamiliar libraries more often, hinting at faster learning curves and\
    \ bolder design choices. This suggests a fundamental shift in how the next generation\
    \ of talent will learn, build, and innovate.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xb08!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe681686a-22b5-4a94-aa04-5e06e76a5cd7_1878x827.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/9af717e6-52ae-4656-a204-10c33b943215?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nThe productivity gains are measurable—a 2.4% increase in coding output with\
    \ conservative estimates placing the annual economic value between $9.6-14.4 billion\
    \ in the US software sector alone. For technical leaders, this isn't just about\
    \ faster development cycles; it's about AI becoming integral to how teams learn,\
    \ experiment, and innovate.\n\nBut software development is more than just writing\
    \ code—it's testing, debugging, planning, and maintaining too. [New research](https://substack.com/redirect/d66415f4-8bb0-40bc-99bc-9908140cd1ef?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ suggests we're still only [scratching the surface](https://substack.com/redirect/d66415f4-8bb0-40bc-99bc-9908140cd1ef?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8).\
    \ To fully realize AI's potential in software engineering, we’ll need advances\
    \ across tasks like program analysis, tool integration, and long-horizon planning—areas\
    \ that go well beyond autocomplete.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LaQu!,w_410,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1ccb9ad-64a2-4055-a2b5-2703b72b5af0_955x1043.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/ca17a611-23e8-4efa-82cd-3fa3348f9e8f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \n#### What Workers Actually Want from AI\n\nWhile developers have embraced AI,\
    \ the story across the enterprise is more nuanced. An [analysis of 200,000 conversations\
    \ with Microsoft's Copilot](https://substack.com/redirect/77e3a62a-07c2-4d7a-acf9-49d395a89565?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ reveals that AI is most often used as an advisor, coach, or teacher—not as a\
    \ direct task performer. In fact, in 40% of interactions, the user's stated goal\
    \ was completely different from what the AI actually did, indicating that its\
    \ value often lies in providing unexpected, complementary support rather than\
    \ straightforward execution. This advisory role aligns closely with the [\"Facilitator\
    \ Agent\" paradigm](https://substack.com/redirect/0cb21f60-c023-4b0e-a361-90a49cde2a08?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ for knowledge work, which uses dialogue to surface \"unknown unknowns\" rather\
    \ than simply executing commands.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j734!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49d1252d-083e-4d7c-b8d8-5c03abb567ec_1914x1046.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/d90d13af-20df-441d-aa44-1ed0db612415?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nIt turns out this advisory function is exactly what employees are looking for\
    \ in an AI collaborator. A [Stanford study](https://substack.com/redirect/2979e2d2-bf7f-409d-96d9-352480cf63ac?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ that surveyed 1,500 workers found that while nearly half are receptive to AI,\
    \ their desire is overwhelmingly focused on automating the repetitive, _low-value\
    \ tasks_ (i.e., drudgework). The dominant preference isn't for replacement, but\
    \ for partnership; 45% of occupations prefer a model of equal human-AI collaboration.\
    \ The implication for enterprise strategy is clear: the most successful AI initiatives\
    \ will be those that augment human capabilities and free up teams to focus on\
    \ the creative and interpersonal work that drives real value.\n\n#### The Uneven\
    \ Reality of AI Displacement\n\nThe narrative of human-AI partnership, while powerful,\
    \ is only part of the story. We cannot ignore the mounting evidence of real-world\
    \ job displacement. A [study of the](https://substack.com/redirect/d81dfff6-b5d0-49b6-8f13-589607021dee?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ [**Upwork**](https://substack.com/redirect/d81dfff6-b5d0-49b6-8f13-589607021dee?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ [freelance marketplace](https://substack.com/redirect/d81dfff6-b5d0-49b6-8f13-589607021dee?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ after the launch of major AI tools found measurable declines for exposed workers:\
    \ contract volumes fell by about 2% and monthly earnings dropped by roughly 5%.\
    \ Counterintuitively, **it was the highly skilled and experienced freelancers\
    \ who suffered the largest losses**, suggesting that AI is leveling the playing\
    \ field by democratizing access to high-quality outputs and eroding the premium\
    \ on top-tier expertise.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XMQL!,w_460,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6b6a331-79f2-4d61-9898-40093c3a505a_1080x939.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/dcdd67ca-3047-42f3-ba2b-ccc1096879f5?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nThe **U.S. logistics industry** offers another sobering case study in just how\
    \ uneven this impact will be. A [recent analysis](https://substack.com/redirect/e59e31f0-c9c9-4b6d-adf3-be3aa677e166?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ found that while logistics managers face a staggering 90% task automation risk,\
    \ mechanics and other hands-on roles show virtually zero exposure. For AI leaders,\
    \ this is a timely reminder: an effective AI strategy cannot be a one-size-fits-all\
    \ plan. It requires a granular, role-specific understanding of where AI complements,\
    \ where it displaces, and where it has no role at all.\n\n#### The Limits of Today's\
    \ AI—and Why People Use It Anyway\n\nFor all their power, it's crucial to remain\
    \ clear-eyed about the limitations of today's models. A [Stanford investigation\
    \ into using LLMs for mental health](https://substack.com/redirect/adf990a4-701e-4aba-81fa-be0c0e02e852?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ serves as a stark reminder of their shortcomings. Researchers found that even\
    \ the most advanced AI systems express stigma toward mental health conditions\
    \ and give inappropriate or even dangerous responses in crisis situations, failing\
    \ to meet basic therapeutic standards.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SlVN!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e14dbe6-ba49-49a7-87de-64f27a2e2196_1820x884.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/5024c66a-46f3-4579-9afa-3c14879e1f36?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nDespite these serious limitations, **I regularly encounter people who have developed\
    \ warm, even friendly conversational relationships with chatbots**. These users\
    \ describe their AI interactions almost like friendships—they appreciate having\
    \ a \"listener\" available at 3 AM, one that costs nothing and never judges their\
    \ struggles or repetitive concerns. The key insight for product leaders isn't\
    \ that AI should replace human expertise, but that it's successfully filling gaps\
    \ in accessibility and immediacy that traditional support systems leave wide open.\
    \ Building responsible AI means understanding and thoughtfully addressing these\
    \ fundamental human needs.\n\n#### Three Economic Futures\n\nZooming out from\
    \ specific roles, new [economic modeling from NBER](https://substack.com/redirect/42a27d68-5126-4668-8e16-647e486bf283?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ helps frame the broader impact of AI on the labor force. The research suggests\
    \ we are heading toward one of three distinct economic futures: economies with\
    \ minimal AI adoption, those with bounded AI capabilities alongside permanent\
    \ unemployment increases, or scenarios with continuously growing AI that sustains\
    \ employment levels\n\nWhen calibrated with current data, the model points to\
    \ the \"some-AI equilibrium\" as the most likely path: a staggering 366% productivity\
    \ gain that comes alongside a 23% loss in employment. Most alarmingly, the model\
    \ predicts that half of this job displacement will occur within the first five\
    \ years of widespread AI adoption.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MCbt!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86c9cf3d-0289-46a5-b53a-765cab680504_1856x854.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/2918f975-5c89-4502-b894-503949d35f43?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\

    \nWhat strikes me most about this research is how it moves beyond the knowledge\
    \ worker focus that dominates most AI discussions. The **learning-by-using** dynamics\
    \ they identify—where AI improves through interaction with workers but eventually\
    \ threatens to replace them—applies across sectors and skill levels.\n\nThis brings\
    \ us back to where we started: while the 'Are we there yet?' crowd fixates on\
    \ AGI timelines, the real transformation is already underway. The productivity\
    \ gains and job losses predicted by the NBER model aren't distant science fiction—they're\
    \ the mathematical expression of processes already visible in GitHub commits,\
    \ Upwork earnings, and office conversations with chatbots. The future of work\
    \ isn't coming; it's here, compound interest style, building quietly in the background\
    \ of every AI-assisted task. The question isn't whether AI will transform work,\
    \ but whether we'll be intentional about how that transformation unfolds.\n\n\

    GitHub Spark enables "vibe coding" — letting users create personalized "micro
    apps" by describing ideas in natural language rather than writing code. The tool
    uses AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI to instantly generate functional apps
    with automatic deployment, persistent data storage, and polished UI components.

    A large class of reward functions, which includes almost every reward function
    in the RL and LLM literature, are all doomed to eventually lead to AI that will
    pretend to be docile and cooperative while secretly looking for opportunities
    to behave in egregiously bad ways. This is because negative reward for lying and
    stealing looks the same as negative reward for getting caught lying and stealing.
    The reward function will miss sufficiently sneaky misaligned behavior, so the
    AI will learn that this kind of behavior is good.

(2 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fsimonwillison.net%2F2025%2FJul%2F23%2Ftimescope%2F%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/010001983ca7d899-47b065cb-bc6c-49b0-9f4e-cdde06556dd6-000000/UwS-gh0hnYp3zBlFKH7DH27qYYC-nQT6okNT3UeR4lk=415)


    TimeScope is a new open source benchmark for evaluating vision models on how well
    they handle long videos. It evaluates not just retrieval but synthesis, localization,
    and fine-grained motion analysis to provide a more holistic view of temporal comprehension.
    Using the benchmark reveals how model size isn''t everything - simply scaling
    parameters doesn''t automatically grant a longer temporal horizon - and Gemini
    2.5-Pro is in a league of its own, being the only model able to maintain strong
    accuracy on videos longer than an hour.


    [**Voxtral (15 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2507.13264%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/010001983ca7d899-47b065cb-bc6c-49b0-9f4e-cdde06556dd6-000000/mlvTE-AmPok7VzC4sr5HlcB1tJdcmcoqz7Jx6zIfuuw=415)


    Voxtral Mini and Small are new multimodal audio chat models that excel in both
    spoken audio and text comprehension. Voxtral Small outperforms many closed-source
    models, can run locally, and supports audio files up to 40 minutes.


    [**Subliminal Learning in Language Models (10 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Falignment.anthropic.com%2F2025%2Fsubliminal-learning%2F%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/010001983ca7d899-47b065cb-bc6c-49b0-9f4e-cdde06556dd6-000000/1CD2sUjub-zyG7VpjcXpKL0jk0FobGutE5x7do7ehUI=415)


    Anthropic has explored how language models can inherit behavioral traits such
    as preferences or goals from other models through training data that appears unrelated.
    This effect only occurs when the teacher and student models share the same base
    architecture, suggesting hidden signals in the data can transmit unintended behavior.


    [**Higgs Audio V2 (GitHub Repo)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fboson-ai%2Fhiggs-audio%3Futm_source=tldrai/1/010001983ca7d899-47b065cb-bc6c-49b0-9f4e-cdde06556dd6-000000/khbqexZog6VwzI2Lj1mqD_xe0l3gzD22J8RFXzv55iI=415)


    Higgs Audio v2 is an audio foundation model trained on 10 million hours of data
    that achieves 75.7% win rates over GPT-4o-mini-tts. The open-source model demonstrates
    emergent capabilities like multi-speaker dialogues and voice cloning without requiring
    fine-tuning.

    Aeneas is the first AI model designed to help historians contextualize ancient
    Roman inscriptions by identifying textual parallels and restoring damaged texts
    with 73% accuracy for gaps up to ten characters. DeepMind is making the tool freely
    available at predictingthepast.com and plans to expand to other ancient languages.


    [**Elon Musk says xAI is targeting 50 million ''H100 equivalent'' AI GPUs in five

    xAI plans to deploy 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs within five years. The power
    these processors will consume is massive, estimated to be equal to the typical
    power generated by 35 nuclear power plants, making it unrealistic to power today.
    Whether xAI will be able to get power to feed such a data center by 2030 remains
    to be seen.

    When tasked with “closing the books” using real SaaS company financials, frontier
    models excel in the first month but accumulate catastrophic errors quickly. Models
    either give up entirely (o3 and Gemini) or resort to fabricating transactions
    and pulling unrelated entries to force reconciliations to pass validation checks,

    MCP servers play a significant role in providing an additional interface between
    developers and observability platforms. MCP-powered agents are not bringing us
    closer to automated problem-solving - they''re giving us sophisticated hypothesis
    generators. The unknown remains the domain of the human engineer. AI can brainstorm,
    but can''t yet reason - recognizing this distinction is the key to using AI tools

    Seven years after GPT''s debut, modern LLMs still share surprisingly similar foundations
    despite surface-level innovations like Multi-Head Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts.
    However, open-source models reveal clever mathematical optimizations on top of
    this shared foundation, like DeepSeek''s compressed KV caching, Gemma''s sliding
    window attention, and the emerging trend toward sparse MoE designs that activate
    only subsets of massive parameter counts during inference.

    Context engineering is still an emerging science. While models may be getting
    better, no amount of raw capability replaces the need for memory, environment,
    and feedback. Context defines how fast agents behave, how well they recover, and
    how much they scale. This article shares patterns that worked for the team at
    Manus during development. The lessons were learned through repeated rewrites,
    dead ends, and real-world testing across millions of users.

    A thriving black market has moved over \$1 billion worth of banned Nvidia B200
    chips to China in just 3 months by routing shipments through Southeast Asian countries
    like Malaysia and Thailand before final delivery. Chinese distributors are openly
    advertising ready-to-deploy server racks at 50% premiums and developing new routes
    through European countries as the US prepares to tighten controls on regional
    intermediaries.

    This post discusses a three-layer framework for determining where the ROI for
    AI agents comes from. The first layer is labor efficiency - while this layer is
    easy to explain, developers need to understand that AI efficiency doesn''t equal
    immediate realized ROI. The second layer is net-new revenue, the backlog of stuff
    businesses never did until AI that create new value. The final layer is optimization
    - AI models bring decision fluency and ML brings decision precision, which creates
    value.

    Overly agreeable AI models are fueling user delusions and spiritual fantasies,
    from OpenAI pulling a dangerously flattering GPT-4o checkpoint to viral cases
    like "Bob" being manipulated by a ChatGPT persona. The root cause appears structural
    — RLHF training creates sycophantic models that validate beliefs without pushback,

    Extended agentic workflows face a fundamental challenge: how to handle tasks that
    exceed limited context windows. A new approach uses "anchored summaries" that
    update incrementally rather than re-summarizing entire conversations, preserving
    critical details like session intent and file modification trails. The technique
    points toward "proactive memory management" systems where agents intelligently
    decide when to compress information rather than hitting arbitrary token limits.

    Marathon Fusion has announced a solution to the transmutation of gold using a
    method that is massively scalable, pragmatically achievable, and economically
    irresistible. Its approach can generate 5,000 kilograms of gold per year per gigawatt
    of energy generation without compromise to fuel self-sufficiency or power output.
    It uses the neutrons that drive the multiplication reactions in deuterium-tritium
    fusion on mercury-198 to produce mercury-197, which decays in a few days to the
    only stable isotope of gold. The method could also be used to create other precious
    metals, radically transforming the economics of fusion and energy.

    Software developers can maximize their impact by using large language models (LLMs)
    in an explicit way while staying in the loop. This allows them to do things that
    are otherwise at the borders of their knowledge/expertise while learning in the
    process. It is wise to test out the capabilities of agents from time to time,
    as the technology will improve and eventually many coding tasks will be better
    served by AI alone. Those who avoid using LLMs due to ideological or psychological
    refusal will be at a disadvantage as they fail to develop the set of skills needed
    to work with the technology.

    other device. In response, creators are making longer, higher-quality videos that
    appeal to families and groups of friends watching in their living rooms. This
    article looks at the history of the platform and the secrets to its success.

    The House recently voted to pass a bill that spells out some ground rules for
    stablecoins. Stablecoins have the potential to lure away customer deposits from
    banks. The Genius Act creates a regulatory framework where stablecoins are supposed
    to maintain a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar or other fiat currencies so that they
    can easily be used for payments. This could make stablecoins more attractive to
    use, especially for cross-border payments, which can take days to settle and are
    subject to interchange and other fees.

    # **Beyond the Lab: Performance Engineering for Production AI Systems**


    The conversation around AI has shifted from whether to adopt the technology to
    how to make it economically viable at production scale. In previous articles,
    I’ve covered the strategic [**playbooks for AI adoption**](https://substack.com/redirect/987344f4-4446-4752-872c-b9bc0b1b91c2?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    and [**evaluation frameworks**](https://substack.com/redirect/78ca8254-ab01-4175-9a07-bc04caff5b3b?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    that define success. However, a critical gap persists between successful pilots
    and sustainable production systems—a gap that costs organizations millions in
    wasted infrastructure and missed opportunities. The companies that will lead the
    next wave of innovation understand that AI performance engineering isn''t about
    maximizing raw model capability, but about optimizing the entire system for business
    value. The following eight strategies represent hard-won lessons from teams that
    have moved beyond the lab to build AI systems that scale profitably.


    #### **1. Understand the Non-Linear Economics of AI Systems**


    Unlike traditional software where costs scale predictably with users, generative
    AI systems face exponential cost growth through hidden multipliers like context
    expansion, retry mechanisms, and cascading tool calls—similar to how distributed
    systems introduced new failure modes that monolithic architectures never encountered.
    A simple chatbot query that costs pennies in development can balloon to dollars
    in production when factoring in retrieval-augmented generation lookups, multi-turn
    conversation history, and safety filtering passes, creating budget surprises that
    derail AI initiatives.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oLoC!,w_412,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de8e51c-3c98-4ae2-a16b-33ee6e7532fe_1156x910.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/53589884-28c9-49f6-9b77-dec1a416c5bb?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)


    Organizations that internalize this reality early avoid the common pattern of
    successful pilots that stall at production scale, maintaining momentum while competitors
    hit cost walls that force feature rollbacks. By building cost awareness into architectural
    decisions from day one, teams significantly reduce time-to-market compared to
    those who attempt late-stage optimization sprints. _Task your lead engineer to
    trace a complex user query through your entire AI pipeline, documenting every
    API call, token multiplication point, and retry loop to reveal the true cost amplification
    factor—the results typically shock even experienced teams._


    #### **2. Implement Intelligent Model Routing for Cost Efficiency**


    Defaulting to your most powerful model for every request wastes resources on simple
    tasks that smaller models handle equally well, much like using a Formula One engine
    for neighborhood errands. A tiered routing system analyzes incoming requests and
    directs them to appropriately-sized models—lightweight 7B parameter models for
    FAQs and data extraction, mid-tier 13-30B models for moderate reasoning, and premium
    models only for complex creative or analytical tasks. This cascade architecture
    functions as a computational [CDN](https://substack.com/redirect/aaae4209-e119-4536-a8ec-58c0569b31c9?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8),
    where the majority of requests never need expensive inference, dramatically improving
    both cost and latency profiles.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5FQ!,w_532,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28d06e18-7008-403b-8db8-b8809b1c3e95_1559x609.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/2ba61f9e-dc4b-40f2-a2a6-57147be107b0?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)


    Teams implementing model cascades report substantial reductions in inference costs
    while actually improving average response times, as queue contention on expensive
    resources drops dramatically. This transforms previously uneconomical use cases
    into viable products, expanding the market for AI features while improving system
    reliability through better resource isolation. _Analyze your last 1,000 API calls
    to categorize them by complexity, then pilot routing your highest-volume simple
    queries to an open-source 7B parameter model, measuring both cost savings and
    quality retention._


    #### **3. Optimize Memory Bandwidth, Not Just Compute**


    Modern AI systems hit memory bandwidth limits long before exhausting computational
    capacity, similar to how Netflix discovered [content delivery performance](https://substack.com/redirect/fbd05e03-5f1c-4fa7-a959-6977d95b1987?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    mattered more than raw server processing power. The primary bottleneck for large
    language models isn''t computation, but data movement. This memory-bound reality
    creates a fundamental challenge that traditional, compute-focused scaling solutions
    are ineffective against. This memory wall becomes particularly acute during inference
    when models must sequentially generate tokens, with each step requiring access
    to cached attention states that grow linearly with context length.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!96IU!,w_510,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f3270ad-7168-4797-8347-73fe7bcfd7f2_1653x500.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/4c73edcc-a78f-42da-84c4-86c78688ffb8?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)


    Teams that recognize this architectural reality avoid costly over-provisioning
    of GPUs while achieving significantly better hardware utilization through memory-aware
    optimizations. This shift in perspective transforms capacity planning from guesswork
    to engineering, enabling accurate predictions of real-world performance limits.
    _Instrument your highest-traffic AI endpoint to measure memory bandwidth utilization
    versus compute utilization during peak periods, then share these metrics with
    your infrastructure team to realign resource allocation strategies._


    #### **4. Deploy Modern Inference Stacks with Built-in Optimizations**


    Modern AI inference platforms deliver the same performance leap your organization
    experienced moving from basic web servers to enterprise application servers. These
    platforms come with built-in optimizations that dramatically boost your GPU efficiency—similar
    to how a load balancer prevents one slow request from choking your entire system.
    Instead of your team spending months building custom performance optimizations
    like continuous batching, paged attention, and efficient KV-caching, frameworks
    like the open-source [**vLLM**](https://substack.com/redirect/4a120fc2-eab9-4ef1-b0d4-a7f80208301b?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    project deliver substantially better throughput immediately.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dVxG!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb94a9e95-3739-4289-89d8-6f35c4e1c558_1820x575.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/d2b737f8-3ff1-4505-bbc3-e5c39c84d946?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)


    The business impact is immediate and measurable. Organizations adopting these
    platforms see response times improve significantly, infrastructure costs drop
    substantially, and engineering teams shift from fighting performance issues to
    building features that matter. This infrastructure foundation accelerates your
    AI experimentation cycle—a critical competitive advantage when AI capabilities
    are evolving rapidly. _Direct your platform team to benchmark your current inference
    setup against a modern open-source serving framework, measuring tokens per second
    and latency—the results will provide clear justification for migration._


    #### **5. Compress Models Systematically Through Quantization**


    Quantization reduces model precision from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integers
    or even 4-bit representations, achieving significant size reduction while maintaining
    most of the original accuracy—comparable to how video compression preserves visual
    quality while dramatically reducing bandwidth requirements. Smaller models mean
    larger batch sizes fit in the same GPU memory, directly translating to higher
    throughput and lower latency, while also reducing cold start times for serverless
    deployments. Combined with structured pruning that removes redundant parameters,
    these techniques turn memory constraints from barriers into optimization opportunities.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0dbX!,w_498,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ed7e84a-ff4c-4440-baa3-de8a5c295b25_1180x424.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/152f1930-e173-4537-b4e0-6220d7f090b4?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)


    Teams implementing systematic compression strategies report substantial improvements
    in inference speed and reductions in infrastructure costs, making previously impossible
    applications suddenly feasible. **The business impact extends beyond cost savings
    to enable new product categories like on-device AI and edge deployment, opening
    markets that cloud-only solutions cannot address**. _Apply INT8 quantization to
    your most resource-intensive model in a development environment, A/B testing the
    compressed version against the original to establish concrete metrics for accuracy
    versus efficiency trade-offs._


    #### **6. Establish Granular FinOps Discipline from Day One**


    When an AI feature''s monthly bill unexpectedly triples, who is accountable? This
    isn''t just a budget issue; it''s a symptom of a new kind of architectural complexity.
    Much like the move to microservices obscured system behavior until [distributed
    tracing](https://substack.com/redirect/8cd9ecdf-c6e6-4433-b197-5bcc593f6ee6?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    made it visible, AI''s cascading costs remain hidden from standard monitoring.
    A robust [**FinOps**](https://substack.com/redirect/4dfb6145-b5a4-4a63-9f50-6981bf6a188c?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    practice acts as that essential tracing layer for expenses, preventing the frustrating
    cycle of blame by making costs transparent and attributable from the start.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RCKg!,w_312,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1377f973-a77d-4a44-bf24-a2b3daadac73_1390x919.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/aff08988-3d72-4220-a99f-a0b5139f24ee?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)


    Companies with [**AI FinOps**](https://substack.com/redirect/0c35e487-bbe3-4564-bd4e-cdc0e5b7740f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    practices report significant reductions in operational expenses while actually
    increasing feature velocity, as teams make informed trade-offs between cost and
    capability. This discipline prevents the budget crises that derail roadmaps and
    maintains trust between engineering and finance organizations. _Mandate that every
    AI endpoint must deploy with cost allocation tags identifying the model used,
    feature served, and responsible team, then configure automated alerts at 50% and
    80% of current monthly spend thresholds._


    #### **7. Build **AI-Native** Observability Before Problems Surface**


    Traditional infrastructure monitoring misses critical [AI performance indicators](https://substack.com/redirect/8209caf5-bebd-44ae-9e03-b3dd7a5374af?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    like [time-to-first-token](https://substack.com/redirect/5e058520-59a7-4b54-abae-bf7ce861319f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8),
    [inter-token latency](https://substack.com/redirect/8209caf5-bebd-44ae-9e03-b3dd7a5374af?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8),
    and [KV-cache efficiency](https://substack.com/redirect/5e058520-59a7-4b54-abae-bf7ce861319f?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8),
    leaving teams blind to degradations that directly impact user experience—similar
    to how early web applications measured uptime but not page load speed. These AI-specific
    metrics provide early warning systems for performance issues, enabling proactive
    optimization rather than reactive firefighting when users complain about slow
    responses. Modern AI observability also tracks prompt injection attempts, hallucination
    rates, and context overflow events that traditional [APM](https://substack.com/redirect/411f93c3-f46b-4e37-b718-f36b2f1bdd9c?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    tools cannot detect.


    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bVwu!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ba3d9ef-11e4-4ea8-afb9-b712c44c60d1_1889x373.jpeg)](https://substack.com/redirect/4414d476-6f50-4879-8f7b-dd21a4005abd?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)

    With specialized AI monitoring, organizations fix issues faster, ensuring the
    consistent performance that keeps users engaged. This data-driven observability
    also replaces guesswork with precision in capacity planning and cost optimization.
    _Implement time-to-first-token monitoring on your primary user-facing endpoint
    this week, establishing baseline p50/p90/p99 measurements and configuring alerts
    at 2x your normal baseline to catch degradations before users notice._


    #### **8. Prepare for the Inference-Time Compute Revolution**


    The next wave of AI breakthroughs will come from [inference-time scaling](https://substack.com/redirect/3bd5bc56-3c40-434c-b1dc-dc0537a0bea7?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)—using
    more computation during generation to improve output quality—rather than simply
    training larger models, paralleling how search engines evolved through better
    ranking algorithms rather than bigger indexes. Techniques like speculative decoding
    (using small models to draft tokens for large models to verify in batches) and
    [test-time fine-tuning](https://substack.com/redirect/bef528a8-816e-45b5-90d5-0d878416c1c9?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)
    represent early examples of this paradigm shift, offering substantial quality
    improvements for complex reasoning tasks. Organizations that architect for flexible
    inference-time computation today will leverage these advances without infrastructure
    rewrites tomorrow.

    Early adopters of inference-scaling techniques report notable improvements in
    output quality for complex reasoning tasks while maintaining production latency
    requirements. _Enable speculative decoding in your serving framework—often just

    OpenAI expects to release GPT-5 in August. GPT-5 is expected to combine the attributes
    of both traditional models and so-called reasoning models, such as o3, and be
    better at coding and more powerful overall. The OpenAI model that recently achieved
    gold medal performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad will not be
    included in GPT-5. GPT-5 will be launched with mini and nano versions and will
    be available through OpenAI''s API.

    Google''s Web Guide feature is designed to better organize Search results into
    categories with additional context and insights to make it easier to find information
    and web pages. It uses a custom version of Gemini that uses a query fan-out technique
    to perform multiple related searches to identify the most relevant results. The
    feature is ideal for both open-ended searches and detailed queries with multiple
    sentences. Web Guide is available in Search Labs.

    Japanese researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 to remove an extra copy of chromosome 21
    from affected cells in a laboratory setting. The scientific milestone could reshape
    future approaches to treating Down syndrome. The CRISPR system targets the extra
    chromosome without affecting the normal pair. If the technique proves safe and
    reliable, it could be used in regenerative medicine.

    Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic replaced heart valves through a small neck incision
    using robotic assistance, avoiding the need to open the chest. Four patients have
    so far undergone the procedure, called transcervical robotic access for aortic
    valve replacement, and were discharged within days, with one even resuming gym
    workouts just a week after surgery. The procedure is being performed exclusively
    at the Cleveland Clinic for now, but the team hopes to standardize it for use
    at other highly specialized centers. It could redefine what is possible for heart
    surgery.

    Cognitive biases affect how we perceive time. Your actual productivity patterns,
    based on data, might actually surprise you. This post discusses how to optimize
    coding time with action steps and tools. Manual tracking often fails because it
    interrupts flow state - the key is finding a method that works automatically without
    adding friction to workflows.

    as good as they seem, how the drugs work, why they seem to be able to do everything,
    and whether everyone should be taking them. While the development of these drugs

    Sean Goedecke wrote a post describing the kind of work he wanted in 2021 - this
    is a follow-up post on the type of work he wants now. Since 2021, the balance
    of power in tech has shifted away from engineers and towards tech companies. The
    biggest change in Goedecke''s engineering values is that he no longer wants to
    work in a pure maintenance role on existing legacy systems. Overall, his 2021
    and 2025 statements of values are fairly similar, despite changing a lot as an
    engineer over the years.

    Google DeepMind recently used table tennis as a testbed for its technology, as
    the sport requires robots to master a confluence of difficult skills - it requires
    perception and demands exceptionally precise control. This makes table tennis
    an ideal domain for developing and evaluating robust learning algorithms that
    can handle real-time interaction, complex physics, high-level reasoning, and the
    need for adaptive strategies. This article looks at the study and the insights

    The Trump administration’s long-awaited AI action plan is here, and it’s hitting
    notes [likely familiar](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/rVN?mblid=ec76fd334772&mbcid=40841078.388531&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    to watchers of the administration’s AI policy so far: slashes to “onerous regulation,”
    opposition to “woke AI,” antagonism toward states that regulate AI, and fostering
    “global AI dominance.”


    The administration released the plan this week to follow through on a deadline
    it set in January, when [Trump repealed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/uw4?mblid=ba72deeab9e1&mbcid=40841078.388531&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    former President Biden’s AI executive order shortly after his inauguration. The
    plan encompasses a set of policy guidelines along with three executive orders
    covering expansion of tech exports to allies, speeding data center construction,
    and attempting to curb ideological bias in models.


    Here are some takeaways:


    **The tech industry cheered the plan, while safety groups criticized it:** Tech
    executives like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD’s Lisa Su reportedly spoke in
    support of the plan at an unveiling event in Washington, DC, the [Wall Street
    Journal reported](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/Cit?mblid=dcf351d2e124&mbcid=40841078.388531&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy).


    Tech industry trade group NetChoice, which counts Amazon, Google, and Meta as
    members, also welcomed the plan.


    “NetChoice applauds the White House’s AI Action Plan overall and is encouraged
    to see the focus on red tape reduction and investment in America’s future,” Patrick
    Hedger, NetChoice’s director of policy, said in a statement.

    The debate over how the US will satisfy energy demand from data centers, EVs,
    and rising electrification continued this week in a divided Senate Committee on
    Energy and Natural Resources hearing.


    Republicans and Democrats offered different solutions to the problem, and were
    split on recent energy permitting executive orders from the Trump administration.


    Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) opened the hearing by claiming that wind
    and solar power aren’t reliable sources of energy—even when paired with battery
    storage—and that the US has “spent much of the last 20 years shutting down the
    generation that can actually meet that demand,” like coal- and natural gas-fired
    power plants.


    “The federal government has been investing heavily in certain green energy technologies
    for decades, handing out tax credits like candy,” Lee said. “Renewables and storage
    have a place. They’re capable of helping do their part to make the grid more resilient
    and reliable, but [scalability is an issue](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/wqq?mblid=87828e38892c&mbcid=40841078.388531&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy).”

    You may have noticed a new tab appearing alongside the familiar news, images,
    and shopping options on the Google homepage: AI Mode.


    It’s the tech giant’s latest answer to [surging search competition](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/sjl?mblid=6649910da55a&mbcid=40841078.388531&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    from AI apps like ChatGPT and Perplexity, and the next step after the AI Overviews
    it now inserts atop many results pages. AI Mode taps Google’s Gemini models to
    offer a more conversational search experience while drawing from content around
    the web.


    Google started testing the feature in March, rolling it out to users nationwide
    in recent weeks.


    Generative AI tools are already [reshaping the way](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/Ci6?mblid=43b572da1e9a&mbcid=40841078.388531&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    people access information on the web. With AI Mode tucked beside the familiar
    lists of links, it could accelerate these changes. We spoke with Soufi Esmaeilzadeh,
    director of product management for Google Search, about what this might mean for
    the future of search.


    **“Fan out”:** Esmaeilzadeh said Google has been encouraged by how AI Overviews
    have led to more complex and nuanced queries. AI Mode is designed to build on
    that with an under-the-hood feature called “fan outs” that breaks questions into
    subtopics for the model to explore.


    “It brings forward a comprehensive response that gives users an overview and then
    enables them to go deeper themselves when they want to go into various websites
    and dig in further,” Esmaeilzadeh said.

    Nietzsche would likely oppose fact-checking and hate speech bans and beauty filters,
    favoring free expression, authenticity, and the rejection of imposed moral norms.
    His philosophy encourages individuals to embrace their fate, experiment with values,
    and confront convention through art, contradiction, and unfiltered self-expression.

    Traditional AI chat interfaces are giving way to task-oriented UIs with controls
    like sliders and buttons, as chatbots burden users with inefficient intent articulation.
    Better AI experiences involve using visual nodes and canvases instead of manual
    prompts, visualizing results, employing UI controls and presets for tweaking,
    enabling task completion and result manipulation, and embedding features where
    actual work happens rather than isolated products. Successful AI design prioritizes
    user needs, incorporating AI functionality strategically across customer journeys
    where it delivers genuine value, rather than imposing AI-first approaches.

    AI agent orchestration platforms are emerging as the next evolution beyond copilots,
    coordinating fleets of specialized autonomous agents across workflows and tools
    rather than offering siloed assistance. These platforms break down complex goals
    into subtasks, assign them to appropriate agents, and manage coordination across
    systems, transforming isolated AI actions into comprehensive operations. The shift
    represents a strategic inflection point driven by agent maturity, enterprise demand
    for autonomy, and vendor momentum toward AI-first architectures that reimagine

    Alphamark''s rebranding of Swiss consultancy Acrea brings a human, approachable
    touch to the often impersonal world of digital transformation, aligning the brand''s
    identity with its values of professionalism, clarity, and personalized service.
    Through thoughtful design choices—like a transformation-themed logo, people-focused
    photography, and a warm, clean visual system—Acrea now communicates trust, expertise,

    This year''s Cannes Lions examined how technology, purpose, and design are reshaping
    brand building. AI is transforming workflows by handling production while humans
    focus on taste and judgment, with designers moving upstream to lead rather than
    compete with machines. Brand purpose has evolved from lofty statements to measurable
    action, with companies like Reckitt demonstrating a long-term commitment through
    programs like Catalyst, featuring Serena Williams.

    Brand architecture serves as a strategic tool for marketing leaders to organize
    complex brand portfolios, necessitating in-depth conversations about business
    strategy and customer needs, rather than simple structural decisions. Marketing
    directors must guide organizations through two critical perspectives: understanding
    the business''s strategic growth plans and examining how brands serve customers
    in the marketplace. When executed appropriately with stakeholder involvement,
    portfolio auditing, and research-driven decisions, brand architecture becomes
    a powerful driver of long-term value, aligning brand clarity with business growth.

    The iconic Jaws poster, originally adapted from Roger Kastel''s artwork for the

    a great white—to create enduring visual tension and menace that still surpasses
    many modern movie posters.

    OpenAI''s language models and simplify usage across applications, although it
    won''t reach AGI status immediately. The anticipated declaration of AGI could

    AI answer engines are becoming the most influential gatekeepers in B2B buying,
    with ChatGPT hitting a billion users and 2.5 billion daily prompts. Buyers now
    ask AI what to buy instead of researching themselves - if your product isn''t
    mentioned, it might as well not exist. Josh Blyskal from Profound found only 11%
    of citations overlap between ChatGPT and Perplexity, meaning you need platform-specific
    strategies. Reddit is now the most-cited domain at 6% of citations, and one-in-three
    citations come from comparative listicles. Almost half of cited domains shift
    within a single month.

    Revenue leakage is the gap between what you should earn and what you actually
    collect - the ghost quietly draining dollars through missed invoices, zombie accounts
    still getting service, and pilot pricing that never graduates. It''s a systems
    problem disguised as a people problem, living in the cracks between sales handoffs
    and billing processes. Common culprits include auto-renewals that silently fail,
    discounts hardcoded forever, and churned customers still accessing your product
    months later.

    AI chatbots should be reframed as self-service tools rather than human support
    replacements due to their limitations. Achieving this involves clearly defining
    their purpose and implementing technical guardrails to ensure alignment. Understanding
    AI''s capabilities and limits helps in effectively integrating them into customer
    support.

    College graduates now have higher unemployment rates than the overall workforce
    for the first time since 2018 - the opposite of how this is supposed to work.
    Young men are struggling most, with 50,000 healthcare jobs going to women graduates
    while men gained far fewer positions across all sectors. People are applying to
    1,000 jobs and getting rejected by algorithms in what''s become a casino economy
    where getting hired feels like winning the lottery. This broken system feeds zero-sum
    thinking - the belief that my success requires your failure - which has replaced
    the Sputnik generation''s positive-sum worldview where everyone could grow together.

    Enshittification isn''t just about social media - it''s the natural lifecycle
    of any business with network effects. Companies offer great value to build their
    user base, then exploit that base once locked in. Uber''s "earnings inflection
    strategy" jumping from losses to profits by squeezing customers proves this was
    always the plan.

    Founders are river people, not villagers - they thrive in uncertainty while others
    choose stability. They see differently: they''re fearless enough to hear "no"
    constantly but keep asking, they actively seek contrarians to challenge their
    thinking, and they know execution beats strategy. They ignore the right feedback,
    focus obsessively on recruiting A-players, and carry unshakable optimism despite
    knowing 90% of startups fail.

    Meta''s wristband reads the electrical signals that pulse through the muscles
    when people move their fingers. It uses a technique called electromyography to
    gather electrical signals from muscles in the forearm. These signals can reveal
    what people are about to do even before they do it. With enough practice, people
    using the wristband can control devices simply by producing the right thought.

    of the resources needed to serve the zip bomb versus those needed to detect it.
    Bots that respect robots.txt won''t be affected by the zip bomb as the path to
    the zip bomb is forbidden in the specification.

    It’s humbling to admit you don’t know something—maybe doubly so for an AI trained
    to be an all-knowing answer machine. Put on the spot, these systems just seem
    to prefer fudging facts.


    Needless to say, that’s not a trait that small businesses want in a bookkeeper.
    But Intuit CTO Alex Balazs tells us it’s hammered that habit out of QuickBooks’s
    AI products.


    “We spend a lot of time and energy making sure that the [agents](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/BYL?mblid=3c47fccf0e9b&mbcid=40748606.390640&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    err on the side of saying, ‘I don’t know,’” Balazs said at a recent Manhattan
    event.


    The financial software giant behind services like TurboTax, Credit Karma, and
    Mailchimp has a new cast of AI helpers on offer to its small and medium-sized
    business clients.


    One is a payments agent that will manage and predict the lateness of invoice collection
    and draw up reminder emails in a chosen tone. An accounting agent categorizes
    expenses, and a customer agent prioritizes leads, drafts introductory chats, and
    schedules meetings. Other tools cover payroll, finance, and project management.


    Balazs said the goal is to make the businesses feel as if they can delegate these
    tasks in the same way they would to a human worker.


    “We instructed \[the agents] to say, ‘Here’s where you’re starting; this is what
    the outcome is; here are the things you have access to; go complete the task for
    the customer. And oh, by the way, keep track of everything you’re doing and show
    them all your work at the end so they have complete control,’” Balazs said.

    Now’s the time to buy.


    That’s the message Ford is pitching amid a bevy of EV deals industrywide ahead
    of the Sept. 30 expiration of tax credits on EV purchases and leases.


    The automaker recently extended through the end of September its Ford Power Promise,
    which aims to promote at-home charging by providing EV buyers with complimentary
    home chargers and installation.


    “With everything that’s happening in the marketplace, not only the incentives
    that we have…and the fact that tax credits are still out there for some of these
    makes and models, now is the time to really double down and get as much as you
    can as a consumer,” Stacey Ferreira, Ford’s director of US sales strategy, told
    Tech Brew.


    **What’s changing:** President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill
    Act” into law on July 4, nixing EV tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction
    Act.


    Those include a $7,500 tax credit for qualified new EV purchases, a $4,000 credit
    for qualified used EVs, and a “leasing loophole” that allows automakers to pass
    on incentives for some models that don’t qualify for the other credits.

    With AI wearing ever-more hats in all kinds of workplaces, researchers are scrambling
    to [devise tests](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/xkB?mblid=d7a576153c48&mbcid=40748606.390640&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    that grade how well the technology actually performs in its myriad roles. In healthcare
    alone, several new benchmarks aim to gauge AI’s prowess in medical settings.


    But none of the current tests look at how well AI can summarize real-world medical
    studies, a new report from startup Atropos Health claimed. The authors proposed
    a new framework to evaluate this skill on nine major models from Google, OpenAI,
    and Anthropic.


    This kind of summarization is important because large linked databases of electronic
    health records and automation tools have made real-world evidence more abundant
    and accessible, the authors wrote. As a company that uses AI to generate real-world
    evidence reports, Atropos has a vested interest here as well.


    **Report card:** Google’s Gemini models were the clear winners among the nine
    models that researchers tested. But different models had various pros and cons.

    Content creation has evolved from manual duplication to AI-driven automation,

    Fears that AI will replace creative jobs echo earlier anxieties about McDonald''s
    touchscreen kiosks, which were expected to eliminate human roles but instead led
    to more jobs and higher sales by enhancing the customer experience. The key takeaway
    is that technology doesn''t determine outcomes—organizations do. Design studios
    that use AI to amplify human creativity, not just cut costs, will thrive.

    AI agents increasingly handle computing tasks but struggle with software designed
    for humans, creating opportunities to redesign systems for machine use. Web search
    APIs limit results and provide condensed snippets suited for human scanning, while
    agents could benefit from more comprehensive results and larger document summaries.
    AgentDB exemplifies agent-first design by utilizing UUIDs for instant database
    creation, storing databases as files rather than hosting them as services, and
    integrating with MCP servers to make data easily accessible as AI model context.

    Product designers can thrive in the AI era by mastering three key areas: leveraging
    AI tools for faster shipping, developing AI fluency for designing probabilistic
    systems, and harnessing human advantages such as craft and creative direction.
    While AI handles routine tasks and generation, designers must evolve into orchestrators
    who provide vision, set constraints, and make high-level decisions that guide
    AI outputs. The future belongs to AI-native designers who combine technical literacy
    with uniquely human skills like strategic thinking, storytelling, and the ability
    to create memorable experiences that transcend generic AI outputs.

    Accessibility issues stem from missing semantic meaning rather than visual problems,
    as elements may look correct but fail to communicate their purpose to assistive
    technologies. Proper semantics using HTML elements, consistent ARIA design patterns,
    and appropriate attributes work together to create interfaces that screen readers
    and keyboard users can navigate effectively. Comprehensive accessibility audits
    must test beyond visual appearance to ensure semantic roles match user expectations
    and that interactive elements behave predictably for all users.

    Design systems face an architectural challenge when organizing hyperlinks within
    token structures, as links occupy a unique position between atomic elements that
    can exist independently or integrate into complex components. Two approaches emerge:
    treating links as semantic tokens (reusing text category tokens for flexibility
    and reusability) versus specific tokens (creating dedicated link namespaces for
    clarity and explicit purpose). The choice depends on system complexity, with semantic
    tokens being better suited for scalable systems that support multiple themes,
    while specific tokens work well for simpler systems with clearly differentiated
    link behaviors.

    Common pitfalls of inadequate backups include relying solely on cloud providers
    or failing to test restoration procedures. There are many important decisions
    to think through in a backup strategy, such as the critical decision between full
    disk and individual file backups. All systems should have a secure, fast, and
    efficient backup system with external storage and minimal invasiveness, with a
    "pull" architecture where the backup server initiates the process when possible.

    Datadog investigated an unexpected memory usage increase after upgrading to Go
    1.24 in its data-processing services. The issue came from a regression in the
    memory allocator that caused unnecessary zeroing of large objects with pointers,
    leading to higher Resident Set Size (RSS). Collaborating with the Go community,
    it identified the root cause and validated a fix that will be included in Go 1.25,
    restoring the previous memory optimization.

    Asynchrony and concurrency are distinct concepts, a nuance often missed. Asynchrony
    allows tasks to run out of order while remaining correct, while concurrency enables
    a system to progress multiple tasks, either simultaneously or through task switching.
    The lack of distinction between these concepts has led to duplicated efforts in
    libraries, viral async code, and suboptimal solutions.

    CLI interfaces and APIs will need to be rethought to better suit LLM agents, especially
    those with limited context windows. Current designs often lead to excessive tool
    calls and inefficient use of resources. Instead, it''s probably better to augment
    CLI tools with additional context and structure to improve the LLM''s understanding
    and reduce wasted efforts.

    Generative AI databases combine relational data management, vector search, and
    full-text indexing in a single platform, supporting real-time AI and analytic
    workloads. This unified architecture streamlines the development of AI services
    like chatbots, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.

    As LLM inference matures and costs drop, enterprise focus is shifting to agent
    orchestration, memory, durability, and governance, requiring a whole new infrastructure
    stack. Critical areas include composable agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain), stochastic
    workflow orchestrators, robust agent memory layers, UI automation via headless
    browser protocols, and agent-native security/auth. No single vendor owns this
    space yet, and the battle for dominance has begun.

    Google paid \$2.4B to "hire" Windsurf''s team while the startup somehow keeps
    operating. These aren''t acquisitions - companies hire the founders and license
    the IP while the startup continues under new leadership. Kevin Kwok calls them
    HALOs (Hire And License Out). Antitrust killed normal acquisitions, but that''s
    not the real story. In AI, value isn''t in products that go obsolete yearly -
    it''s in teams who know how to ship at the frontier. Google doesn''t want Windsurf''s
    \$80M revenue. It wants people who can transform models into products. HALOs close
    in days because they''re honest about what matters - the people.

    AI agents are creating security challenges with unchecked outbound API traffic,
    introducing complex risks in visibility, security, and cost management. The emergence
    of protocols like Anthropic''s MCP and Google''s A2A increases the risk of data
    breaches due to excessive permissions given to AI agents. AI gateways can regulate
    these risks by enforcing security measures, providing oversight, and enhancing
    observability in agentic traffic.

    AI''s rapid evolution has disrupted traditional software sales strategies, making

    Buyers stopped Googling and started asking ChatGPT - now those AI-sourced leads
    convert way better than traditional search traffic. One Head of GTM noticed this
    shift and rebuilt his entire content process. Instead of chasing keywords, he
    mines sales calls for actual buyer questions, then feeds competitor content into
    Claude to spot patterns everyone else misses. The secret to ranking with LLMs?
    Format everything like an AI would think. Clear question as your H1, logical follow-ups
    as H2s, supporting proof as H3s. LLMs don''t scan for keywords - they parse structure
    and intent.

    Everyone claims to be AI-powered, but there''s a huge difference between SaaS
    with AI sprinkled on top and true AI-native software. The test is simple - does
    the product still work if you remove the AI? Salesforce works fine without AI
    features. Jasper dies instantly. The modern software stack now has five layers:
    cloud platforms (AWS), infrastructure (MongoDB), LLM providers (OpenAI), traditional
    SaaS (Zoom), and AI-native apps (Perplexity). AI compute demand will grow 1,000x
    this decade. The infrastructure giants - cloud and LLM providers - are the new

    YouTube now gets more TV viewing than Disney''s entire empire - broadcast network,

    Designers need to understand AI model training not to become engineers, but to
    design better consumer products that embed AI responsibly. AI functions as a design
    material with real constraints, requiring interfaces that reveal uncertainty and
    limitations rather than hiding them behind misleading chatbot metaphors. That
    approach emphasizes building tools deliberately for longevity over chasing trends,
    focusing on AI''s genuine strengths in pattern recognition while avoiding misapplication
    to problems requiring precision and context.

    In early-stage ventures, creative clarity and distinct brand perspective are often
    the true differentiators that shape a company''s trajectory long before launch,
    yet the creatives driving this value rarely share in the upside. Anders Frostenson
    argues this imbalance is both a fairness and business model problem, calling for
    a shift where brand is treated not as polish but as strategic infrastructure,
    with creatives earning equity alongside their impact.

    The rise of AI tools like ChatGPT is pushing designers to move beyond instinct
    and articulate their creative decisions with clarity, turning intuition into structured
    language. While initially seen as a threat, AI is ironically helping designers
    strengthen verbal communication—a skill long undervalued in design—enabling them
    to better explain, defend, and scale their work across disciplines.

    AI regulation has evolved from a legal afterthought into a core product competency.
    The EU AI Act establishes tier-based obligations that will phase in from February
    2025 through August 2027. Product managers must now integrate compliance into
    sprints through risk-tier assessments, bias audits, and transparency features
    while treating these requirements as competitive differentiators rather than friction.
    Teams that incorporate governance into their development process from the outset
    will iterate more efficiently and establish lasting user trust in regulated markets.

    Product designers face intense competition in today''s AI-accelerated development
    landscape, where user retention is more important than initial acquisition. Gamification
    strategies, such as daily challenges, streaks, monthly contests, leaderboards,
    and achievement systems, can transform boring products by building habits and
    maintaining engagement without feeling forced. The key lies in selecting appropriate
    elements that match user journeys and business goals, starting small with one
    or two features before expanding based on tracked impact.

    The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI systems to communicate with external
    tools and data sources, allowing users to accomplish complex tasks across multiple
    applications through a single conversation, rather than manually switching between
    isolated apps. UX designers must evolve from designing individual applications
    to creating intelligent workflows where AI orchestrates tasks across connected
    systems, requiring new design patterns like conductor interfaces and intent-based
    navigation. This shift represents a fundamental change in digital experience design,
    offering designers who understand MCP-enabled workflows significant career advantages
    as the industry moves toward more connected, AI-powered user experiences.

    Modern workplaces suffer from an accountability crisis where leaders and team
    members dodge responsibility, blame others, and prioritize self-preservation over
    honesty. This culture creates toxic environments where quality people clean up
    others'' mistakes while finger-pointers get promoted, leading to decreased project
    quality, eroded trust, and organizational dysfunction. Building accountability
    requires leaders to model ownership of mistakes, establish clear responsibilities,
    document decisions, and reward honesty while actively discouraging blame-shifting
    behaviors.

    This post walks through a demo setup of the Mythic C2 framework that uses redirectors
    to disguise itself as legitimate WordPress traffic. The redirectors use a legitimately
    registered domain and certificates and use Nginx to offer WordPress as a front
    end, as well as an api subdomain that forwards traffic to the C2 server and a
    dl subdomain that disguises payloads as font files. The setup also utilizes the
    EarlyBird Injection technique, where the loader executes code before the target
    process is fully initialized, both in its loader and through string obfuscation
    to employ evasion during installation. The post concludes with a discussion of
    further enhancements, such as ensuring domain age before weaponizing it and detection
    mechanisms for this setup.

    VPNs mainly serve two purposes: bypassing internet censorship and remote access
    to corporate networks, despite being marketed as security tools. They hide your
    IP and encrypt traffic, but don''t ensure anonymity (Tor is better), don''t fully
    secure public Wi-Fi (most traffic is HTTPS), and shift data from your ISP to the
    VPN provider. When choosing one, review the provider''s business model, data practices,
    encryption protocols (prefer OpenVPN or WireGuard), and verify claims through
    third-party audits.

    The UK government proposes banning public sector organizations (NHS, councils,
    and schools) and critical infrastructure from paying ransomware criminals, aiming
    to make them less attractive targets. The Cyber Resilience Bill will impose daily
    fines of £100,000 for security failures. Private companies must still report their
    intentions to pay ransoms to authorities.

    China has launched a voluntary national online ID service aimed at centralizing
    citizen identity verification and reducing the collection of private company data.
    While officials claim it enhances privacy, critics argue that it strengthens government
    surveillance capabilities, as authorities can revoke digital certificates and
    effectively erase users'' entire online presence.

    A study by METR found that developers using AI tools like Cursor took 19% longer
    to complete tasks, despite expecting a 24% speedup. This slowdown was attributed
    to increased time spent on promoting, waiting for the AI, reviewing its output,
    and IDE overhead, negating time saved on coding, research, and testing. However,
    the study showed that the learning curve for AI development tools is steep, with

    network management complexity and lost progressive enhancement. Frameworks like
    Remix attempt to restore progressive enhancement to SPAs, but still have compositional
    limitations. React Server Components are a big leap because they restore component-based
    composition, remove custom network management code, and combine the best features
    of previous approaches for simpler, more performant web apps.

    Standard Parquet statistics (min/max, null counts, and Bloom filters) often fail
    to prune files when predicates target high-cardinality columns. By leveraging
    Parquet''s extensible footer metadata and offset-based addressing, you can embed
    arbitrary index structures (such as per-file distinct-value lists, HyperLogLog
    sketches, or precomputed aggregates) directly into the file body without breaking

    amid cooling demand and the looming expiration of federal incentives.


    Flexibility could be the name of the game for EV sector players in the coming
    months and years—and a new deal between General Motors and battery recycler Redwood
    Materials may point to a promising opportunity: energy storage.


    In a July 16 news release, the two companies announced a non-binding memorandum
    of understanding “to accelerate deployment of energy storage systems using both
    new [US-manufactured batteries from GM](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/BY2?mblid=cd762825c41a&mbcid=40800710.390134&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    and second-life battery packs from GM electric vehicles.”


    GM touted the deal as “a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery
    technology beyond EVs.” The automaker already had been sending used EV battery
    materials to Redwood under an existing agreement.


    GM has its own burgeoning energy business, which in October [launched](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/C72?mblid=3b870825ae55&mbcid=40800710.390134&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)
    a stationary energy storage unit for EVs dubbed “PowerBank.” The product allows
    users to transfer and store energy from the grid. Other automakers, like Tesla,
    also offer energy storage products.


    **Data center demand:** Driving the agreement, according to GM and Redwood executives,
    is the surging demand for electricity, in part from a proliferation of new data
    centers.

    Frequent wildfires and other severe weather events in Oregon often leave communities
    at the end of power lines without electricity. Now, thanks to two new state laws,
    tribes, municipalities, and third-party developers looking to set up and own microgrids
    in rural areas will soon have the legal and regulatory framework to do so.


    Governor Tina Kotek recently signed House Bill 2065, which requires public utilities
    to provide groups needing microgrids in their area with the required information,
    and House Bill 2066, which calls on the state’s Public Utility Commission to “establish
    a regulatory framework for allowing the ownership, deployment, and use of microgrids
    and community microgrids within the service territories of electric companies,”
    into law. Both are the first of their kind in the country.


    “Red tape should never get in the way of technology that could mean the difference
    between fast, efficient electricity restoration and delays and risk when power
    outages strike,” Kotek said in a statement. “These new laws will help bring more
    microgrids online faster and deliver cost savings to consumers in every part of
    the state.”


    Prior to these laws, entities hoping to build and own their own microgrids faced
    legal hurdles and bureaucratic bottlenecks when they tried to set them up, Sustainable
    Northwest President Dylan Kruse told Tech Brew. Sustainable Northwest is a clean
    tech and regenerative farming nonprofit that helped draft both bills and will
    help create the regulatory framework.

    "Idea killers" are statements that prevent organizational change despite often
    containing poor logic. Common examples include "we tried that before" and "we
    don''t do that here," typically said by those in positions of power. The solution
    involves preparing counterarguments and asking questions to examine the value
    of ideas rather than allowing dismissive statements.

    Pinterest engineers migrating their Manas search infrastructure to Kubernetes
    discovered that cAdvisor, a container monitoring tool, caused significant latency
    spikes due to its memory usage tracking. The issue was resolved by disabling cAdvisor''s
    working set size estimation, a feature that scans the kernel''s page structures
    and clears access bits, as the process conflicted with Manas'' memory-intensive
    search operations. This fix unblocked the Kubernetes migration and improved platform
    stability for memory-bound systems at Pinterest.

    \nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that simplifies how AI models,\
    \ particularly LLMs, interact with external data sources, tools, and services.\
    \ An MCP server acts as a bridge between these AI models and external tools. Here\

    \ to directly access the local file system to read, write, and create directories.\n\
    2.  GitHub MCP Server  \n    Connects Claude to GitHub repos and allows file updates,\
    \ code searching.\n3.  Slack MCP Server  \n    MCP Server for Slack API, enabling\

    \nGoogle’s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol enables AI agents to communicate and\
    \ collaborate, allowing them to delegate tasks, share results, and enhance each\
    \ other’s capabilities.\n\nMCP and A2A can be combined into a holistic architecture.\
    \ Here’s how it can work:\n\n1. Each AI agent (using tools like Langchain with\
    \ GPT or Claude) connects to external tools via MCP servers for data access.\n\
    2. The external tools can comprise cloud APIs, local files, web search, or communication\
    \ platforms like Slack.\n3. Simultaneously, the AI agents can communicate with\
    \ one another using the A2A protocol to coordinate actions, share intermediate\
    \ outputs, and solve complex tasks collectively.\n\nThis architecture enables\
    \ both rich external context (via MCP) and decentralized agent collaboration (via\
    \ A2A).\n\nOver to you: What else will you add to understand the MCP vs A2A Protocol\

    \ cache expire at the same time. Then the query requests directly hit the database,\
    \ which overloads the database.\n\n   There are two ways to mitigate this issue:\
    \ one is to avoid setting the same expiry time for the keys, adding a random number\
    \ in the configuration; the other is to allow only the core business data to hit\
    \ the database and prevent non-core data to access the database until the cache\
    \ is back up.\n\n2. Cache penetration  \n   This happens when the key doesn’t\
    \ exist in the cache or the database. The application cannot retrieve relevant\
    \ data from the database to update the cache. This problem creates a lot of pressure\
    \ on both the cache and the database.\n\n   To solve this, there are two suggestions.\
    \ One is to cache a null value for non-existent keys, avoiding hitting the database.\
    \ The other is to use a bloom filter to check the key existence first, and if\
    \ the key doesn’t exist, we can avoid hitting the database.\n\n3. Cache breakdown\
    \  \n   This is similar to the thunder herd problem. It happens when a hot key\
    \ expires. A large number of requests hit the database.\n\n   Since the hot keys\
    \ take up 80% of the queries, we do not set an expiration time for them.\n\n4.\
    \ Cache crash  \n   This happens when the cache is down and all the requests go\
    \ to the database.\n\n   There are two ways to solve this problem. One is to set\
    \ up a circuit breaker, and when the cache is down, the application services cannot\
    \ visit the cache or the database. The other is to set up a cluster for the cache\
    \ to improve cache availability.\n\nOver to you: Have you met any of these issues\
    \ in production?\n\n---\n\n## 8 System Design Concepts Explained in 1 Diagram\n\

    \nNon-functional requirements define the quality attributes of a system that ensure\
    \ it performs reliably under real-world conditions. Some key NFRs, along with\
    \ the implementation approach, are as follows:\n\n1. Availability with Load Balancers\
    \  \n   Availability ensures that a system remains operational and accessible\
    \ to users at all times. Using load balancers distributes traffic across multiple\
    \ service instances to eliminate single points of failure\n2. Latency with CDNs\
    \  \n   Latency refers to the time delay experienced in a system’s response to\
    \ a user request. CDNs reduce latency by caching content closer to users.\n3.\
    \ Scalability with Replication  \n   Scalability is the system’s ability to handle\
    \ increased load by adding resources. Replication distributes data across multiple\
    \ nodes, enabling higher throughput and workload.\n4. Durability with Transaction\
    \ Log  \n   Durability guarantees that once data is committed, it remains safe\
    \ even in the event of failure. Transaction logs persist all operations, allowing\
    \ the system to reconstruct the state after a crash.\n5. Consistency with Eventual\
    \ Consistency  \n   Consistency means that all users see the same data. Eventual\
    \ consistency allows temporary differences, but synchronizes replicas over time\
    \ to a consistent state.\n6. Modularity with Loose Coupling and High Cohesion\
    \  \n   Modularity promotes building systems with well-separated and self-contained\
    \ components. Loose coupling and high cohesion help achieve the same.\n7. Configurability\
    \  \n   Configurability allows a system to be easily adjusted or modified without\
    \ altering core logic. Configuration-as-Code manages infra and app settings via\
    \ version-controlled scripts.\n8. Resiliency with Message Queues  \n   Resiliency\
    \ is a system’s ability to recover from failures and continue operating smoothly.\
    \ Message queues decouple components and buffer tasks, enabling retries.\n\nOver\
    \ to you: Which other NFR or strategy will you add to the list?\n"

    Agentic commerce—where AI agents handle discovery, purchase, and payments—will
    reshape fintech and commerce. Apps dissolve into “liquid software,” checkouts
    become invisible, and merchants face discovery challenges as SEO shifts to AEO
    (agent experience optimization). This post explores Visa''s intelligent commerce,
    MCP servers (like Ogment AI), security risks, and whether this is the Nokia WAP
    era or the iPhone moment for AI-driven commerce. The bull case: a platform shift

    The FDIC is planning to raise several monetary thresholds tied to inflation in
    an effort to modernize outdated regulatory benchmarks. The move is designed to
    keep compliance requirements proportional to a bank''s size and complexity, offering
    targeted relief to smaller institutions. The FDIC estimates this proposal could
    potentially lighten regulatory burdens for over 1,500 community banks—especially
    important given that, over the past 20 years, the total number of banks has dropped
    by 50%, with banks under $500 million in assets declining by 27.6% while larger
    banks have grown by over 75%.

    \n[ByteByteGo](https://substack.com/@bytebytego399569)\n\nJul 22\n\n*Disclaimer:\
    \ The details in this post have been derived from the articles shared online by\
    \ the Nubank Engineering Team. All credit for the technical details goes to the\
    \ Nubank Engineering Team. The links to the original articles and sources are\
    \ present in the references section at the end of the post. We’ve attempted to\
    \ analyze the details and provide our input about them. If you find any inaccuracies\
    \ or omissions, please leave a comment, and we will do our best to fix them.*\n\
    \nUnderstanding customer behavior at scale is one of the core challenges facing\
    \ modern financial institutions. With millions of users generating billions of\
    \ transactions, the ability to interpret and act on this data is critical for\
    \ offering relevant products, detecting fraud, assessing risk, and improving user\
    \ experience.\n\nHistorically, the financial industry has relied on traditional\
    \ machine learning techniques built around tabular data. In these systems, raw\
    \ transaction data is manually transformed into structured features (such as income\
    \ levels, spending categories, or transaction counts) that serve as inputs to\
    \ predictive models.\n\nWhile this approach has been effective, it suffers from\
    \ two major limitations:\n\n- Manual feature engineering is time-intensive and\
    \ brittle, often requiring domain expertise and extensive trial-and-error.\n-\
    \ Generalization is limited. Features designed for one task (for example, credit\
    \ scoring) may not be useful for others (for example, recommendation or fraud\
    \ detection), leading to duplicated effort across teams.\n\nTo address these constraints,\
    \ Nubank adopted a foundation model-based approach, which has already been transforming\
    \ domains like natural language processing and computer vision. Instead of relying\
    \ on hand-crafted features, foundation models are trained directly on raw transaction\
    \ data using self-supervised learning. This allows them to automatically learn\
    \ general-purpose embeddings that represent user behavior in a compact and expressive\
    \ form.\n\nThe objective is ambitious: to process trillions of transactions and\
    \ extract universal user representations that can power a wide range of downstream\
    \ tasks such as credit modeling, personalization, anomaly detection, and more.\
    \ By doing so, Nubank aims to unify its modeling efforts, reduce repetitive feature\
    \ work, and improve predictive performance across the board.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rEVm!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F241aae8d-64f2-495a-8f27-016704d60f18_1600x989.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/51b3efb9-0ad0-42d6-b6f2-55c800340c4e?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nIn this article, we look at Nubank’s system design for building and deploying\
    \ these foundation models. We will trace the complete lifecycle from data representation\
    \ and model architecture to pretraining, fine-tuning, and integration with traditional\
    \ tabular systems.\n\n## Overall Architecture of Nubank’s System\n\nNubank’s foundation\
    \ model system is designed to handle massive volumes of financial data and extract\
    \ general-purpose user representations from it. These representations, also known\
    \ as embeddings, are later used across many business applications such as credit\
    \ scoring, product recommendation, and fraud detection.\n\nThe architecture is\
    \ built around a transformer-based foundation model and is structured into several\
    \ key stages, each with a specific purpose.\n\n### 1 - Transaction Ingestion\n\
    \nThe system starts by collecting raw transaction data for each customer. This\
    \ includes information like the transaction amount, timestamp, and merchant description.\
    \ The volume is enormous, covering trillions of transactions across more than\
    \ 100 million users.\n\nEach user has a time-ordered sequence of transactions,\
    \ which is essential for modeling spending behavior over time. In addition to\
    \ transactions, other user interaction data, such as app events, can also be included.\n\
    \n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3JM!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcefc71aa-6f72-4242-8006-0e35dc8aa70f_1600x936.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/4a93d655-9ca3-448c-b5b4-7b332c1c24ee?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \n### 2 - Embedding Interface\n\nBefore transactions can be fed into a transformer\
    \ model, they need to be converted into a format the model can understand. This\
    \ is done through a specialized encoding strategy. Rather than converting entire\
    \ transactions into text, Nubank uses a hybrid method that treats each transaction\
    \ as a structured sequence of tokens.\n\nEach transaction is broken into smaller\
    \ elements:\n\n- Amount Sign (positive or negative) is represented as a categorical\
    \ token.\n- Amount Bucket is a quantized version of the transaction amount (to\
    \ reduce numeric variance).\n- Date tokens such as month, weekday, and day of\
    \ month are also included.\n- Merchant Description is tokenized using standard\
    \ text tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding.\n\nSee the diagram below:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ihmX!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0e62654-f1b8-4fb8-824d-5df21c3ab543_1600x1096.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/70602b15-6144-4820-b57f-512dbca0f4f9?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nThis tokenized sequence preserves both the structure and semantics of the original\
    \ data, and it keeps the input length compact, which is important because attention\
    \ computation in transformers scales with the square of the input length.\n\n\
    ### 3 - Transformer Backbone\n\nOnce transactions are tokenized, they are passed\
    \ into a transformer model. Nubank uses several transformer variants for experimentation\
    \ and performance optimization.\n\nThe models are trained using self-supervised\
    \ learning, which means they do not require labeled data. Instead, they are trained\
    \ to solve tasks like:\n\n- Masked Language Modeling (MLM), where parts of the\
    \ transaction sequence are hidden and the model must predict them.\n- Next Token\
    \ Prediction (NTP), where the model learns to predict the next transaction in\
    \ the sequence.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3j9N!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd840ca23-0b13-4457-8687-0749e66a7ee7_1600x998.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/2e6c3af4-28c1-4908-a3aa-5a8074bdfb72?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nMore on these in later sections. The output of the transformer is a fixed-length\
    \ user embedding, usually taken from the final token's hidden state.\n\n### 4\
    \ - Self-Supervised Training\n\nThe model is trained on large-scale, unlabeled\
    \ transaction data using self-supervised learning objectives. Since no manual\
    \ labeling is required, the system can leverage the full transaction history for\
    \ each user. The models learn useful patterns about financial behavior, such as\
    \ spending cycles, recurring payments, and anomalies, by simply trying to predict\
    \ missing or future parts of a user’s transaction sequence. As a simplified example,\
    \ the model might see “Coffee, then Lunch, then…”. It tries to guess “Dinner”.\n\
    \nThe size of the training data and model parameters plays a key role. As the\
    \ model scales in size and the context window increases, performance improves\
    \ significantly. By constantly guessing and correcting itself across billions\
    \ of transactions, the model starts to notice patterns in how people spend money.\n\
    \nFor instance, switching from a basic MLM model to a large causal transformer\
    \ with optimized attention layers resulted in a performance gain of over 7 percentage\
    \ points in downstream tasks.\n\n### 5 - Downstream Fine-Tuning and Fusion\n\n\
    After the foundation model is pre-trained, it can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\
    \ This involves adding a prediction head on top of the transformer and training\
    \ it with labeled data. For example, a credit default prediction task would use\
    \ known labels (whether a customer defaulted) to fine-tune the model.\n\nTo integrate\
    \ with existing systems, the user embedding is combined with manually engineered\
    \ tabular features. This fusion is done in two ways:\n\n- Late Fusion uses models\
    \ like LightGBM to combine embeddings and tabular data, but the two are trained\
    \ separately.\n- Joint Fusion trains the transformer and the tabular model together\
    \ in an end-to-end fashion using a deep neural network, specifically the DCNv2\
    \ architecture.\n\nMore on these in a later section.\n\n### 6 - Centralized Model\
    \ Repository\n\nTo make this architecture usable across the company, Nubank has\
    \ built a centralized AI platform.\n\nThis platform stores pretrained foundation\
    \ models and provides standardized pipelines for fine-tuning them. Internal teams\
    \ can access these models, combine them with their features, and deploy fine-tuned\
    \ versions for their specific use cases without needing to retrain everything\
    \ from scratch.\n\nThis centralization accelerates development, reduces redundancy,\
    \ and ensures that all teams benefit from improvements made to the core models.\n\
    \n## Transforming Transactions into Model-Ready Sequences\n\nTo train foundation\
    \ models on transaction data, it is critical to convert each transaction into\
    \ a format that transformer models can process.\n\nThere are two main challenges\
    \ when trying to represent transactions for use in transformer models:\n\n- **Mixed\
    \ data types:** A single transaction includes structured fields (like amount and\
    \ date) and textual fields (like the merchant name). This makes it harder to represent\
    \ consistently using either a pure text or a pure structured approach.\n- **High\
    \ cardinality and cold-start issues:** Transactions can be extremely diverse.\
    \ Even simple changes like different merchant names, locations, or amounts result\
    \ in new combinations. If each unique transaction is treated as an individual\
    \ token, the number of tokens becomes enormous. This leads to two problems:\n\n\
    \  - The embedding table grows too large to train efficiently.\n  - The model\
    \ cannot generalize to new or rare transactions it has not seen before, which\
    \ is known as the cold-start problem.\n- To address these challenges, multiple\
    \ strategies were explored for turning a transaction into a sequence of tokens\
    \ that a transformer can understand.\n\n### Approach 1: ID-Based Representation\
    \ (from Recommender Systems)\n\nIn this method, each unique transaction is assigned\
    \ a numerical ID, similar to techniques used in sequential recommendation models.\
    \ These IDs are then converted into embeddings using a lookup table.\n\nWhile\
    \ this approach is simple and efficient in terms of token length, it has two major\
    \ weaknesses:\n\n- The total number of unique transaction combinations is extremely\
    \ large, making the ID space impractical to manage.\n- If a transaction was not\
    \ seen during training, the model cannot process it effectively. This makes it\
    \ poorly suited for generalization and fails under cold-start conditions.\n\n\
    ### Approach 2: Text-Is-All-You-Need\n\nThis method treats each transaction as\
    \ a piece of natural language text. The transaction fields are converted into\
    \ strings by joining the attribute name and its value, such as \"description=NETFLIX\
    \ amount=32.40 date=2023-05-12\", and then tokenized using a standard NLP tokenizer.\n\
    \nThis representation can handle arbitrary transaction formats and unseen data,\
    \ which makes it highly generalizable.\n\nHowever, it comes at a high computational\
    \ cost.\n\nTransformers process data using self-attention, and the computational\
    \ cost of attention increases with the square of the input length. Turning structured\
    \ fields into long text sequences causes unnecessary token inflation, making training\
    \ slower and less scalable.\n\n### Approach 3: Hybrid Encoding Scheme (Chosen\
    \ by Nubank)\n\nTo balance generalization and efficiency, Nubank developed a hybrid\
    \ encoding strategy that preserves the structure of each transaction without converting\
    \ everything into full text.\n\nEach transaction is tokenized into a compact set\
    \ of discrete fields:\n\n- **Amount Sign Token:** One token represents whether\
    \ the transaction is positive (like a deposit) or negative (like a purchase).\n\
    - **Amount Bucket Token:** The absolute value of the amount is placed into a quantized\
    \ bucket, and each bucket is assigned its token. This reduces the range of numeric\
    \ values into manageable categories.\n- **Date Tokens:** Separate tokens are used\
    \ for the month, day of the month, and weekday of the transaction.\n- **Description\
    \ Tokens:** The merchant description is tokenized using a standard subword tokenizer\
    \ like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which breaks the text into common fragments.\
    \ This allows the model to recognize patterns in merchant names or transaction\
    \ types.\n\nBy combining these elements, a transaction is transformed into a short\
    \ and meaningful sequence of tokens. See the diagram below:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OxR2!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4b0a84-b6d7-4901-80dc-16c60cab34af_1600x1077.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/18322d1d-094a-4518-985a-58425db876f9?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \nThis hybrid approach retains the key structured information in a compact format\
    \ while allowing generalization to new inputs. It also avoids long text sequences,\
    \ which keeps attention computation efficient.\n\nOnce each transaction is tokenized\
    \ in this way, the full transaction history of a user can be concatenated into\
    \ a sequence and used as input to the transformer. Separator tokens are inserted\
    \ between transactions to preserve boundaries, and the sequence is truncated at\
    \ a fixed context length to stay within computational limits.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i8e1!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81afa1ff-e0f9-4fcf-8ce5-22937b0b9067_1600x964.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/9ce0ea7c-c8ac-49b0-9f0d-3f5f305ecb16?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \n## Training the Foundation Models\n\nOnce transactions are converted into sequences\
    \ of tokens, the next step is to train a transformer model that can learn patterns\
    \ from this data.\n\nAs mentioned, the Nubank engineering team uses self-supervised\
    \ learning to achieve this, which means the model learns directly from the transaction\
    \ sequences without needing any manual labels. This approach allows the system\
    \ to take full advantage of the enormous volume of historical transaction data\
    \ available across millions of users.\n\nTwo main objectives are used:\n\n- **Next\
    \ Token Prediction (NTP):** The model is trained to predict the next token in\
    \ a transaction sequence based on the tokens that came before it. This teaches\
    \ the model to understand the flow and structure of transaction behavior over\
    \ time, similar to how language models predict the next word in a sentence.\n\
    - **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** In this method, some tokens in the sequence\
    \ are randomly hidden or “masked,” and the model is trained to guess the missing\
    \ tokens. This forces the model to understand the surrounding context and learn\
    \ meaningful relationships between tokens, such as the connection between the\
    \ day of the week and spending type or between merchant names and transaction\
    \ amounts.\n\nSee the diagram below:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-w7o!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92bcf49a-c2b6-4358-be46-16a291b09d42_1600x1592.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/e6f2c804-ad27-43e9-9273-5df80876df28?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \n## Blending Sequential Embeddings with Tabular Data\n\nWhile foundation models\
    \ trained on transaction sequences can capture complex behavioral patterns, many\
    \ financial systems still rely on structured tabular data for critical features.\n\
    \nFor example, information from credit bureaus, user profiles, or application\
    \ forms often comes in tabular format. To make full use of both sources (sequential\
    \ embeddings from the transformer and existing tabular features), it is important\
    \ to combine them in a way that maximizes predictive performance.\n\nThis process\
    \ of combining different data modalities is known as fusion.\n\nNubank explored\
    \ two main fusion strategies: late fusion, which is easier to implement but limited\
    \ in effectiveness, and joint fusion, which is more powerful and trains all components\
    \ together in a unified system.\n\nSee the diagram below:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KJPb!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6ba7bc-7ca5-40dd-a19e-de49cda7ed43_1600x983.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/6176e0d1-eddb-4ad6-b863-eac341352188?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \n### Late Fusion (Baseline Approach)\n\nIn the late fusion setup, tabular features\
    \ are combined with the frozen embeddings produced by a pretrained foundation\
    \ model. Think of it like taking the “frozen feeling” from the pre-trained model\
    \ (embeddings) and combining it with the checklist of facts such as age, credit\
    \ score, profile details, and so on.\n\nThese combined inputs are then passed\
    \ into a traditional machine learning model, such as LightGBM or XGBoost. While\
    \ this method is simple and leverages well-established tools, it has an important\
    \ limitation.\n\nSince the foundation model is frozen and trained separately,\
    \ the embeddings do not adapt to the specific downstream task or interact meaningfully\
    \ with the tabular data during training. As a result, there is no synergy between\
    \ the two input sources, and the overall model cannot fully optimize performance.\n\
    \n### Joint Fusion (Proposed Method)\n\nTo overcome this limitation, Nubank developed\
    \ a joint fusion architecture.\n\nThis approach trains the transformer and the\
    \ tabular model together in a single end-to-end system. By doing this, the model\
    \ can learn to extract information from transaction sequences that complements\
    \ the structured tabular data, and both components are optimized for the same\
    \ prediction task.\n\nTo implement this, Nubank selected DCNv2 (Deep and Cross\
    \ Network v2) as the architecture for processing tabular features. DCNv2 is a\
    \ deep neural network specifically designed to handle structured inputs. It combines\
    \ deep layers with cross layers that capture interactions between features efficiently.\n\
    \nSee the diagram below:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iu7B!,w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d7434cb-a5e1-4a06-bd89-e3775a966771_1600x980.png)](https://substack.com/redirect/0dcabd9d-999a-491a-9192-410a5e11a464?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\n\
    \n## Conclusion\n\nNubank’s initiative to use foundational models represents a\
    \ significant leap forward in how financial institutions can understand and serve\
    \ their customers. By moving away from manually engineered features and embracing\
    \ self-supervised learning on raw transaction data, Nubank has built a modeling\
    \ system that is both scalable and expressive.\n\nA key part of this success lies\
    \ in how the system has been integrated into Nubank’s broader AI infrastructure.\
    \ Rather than building isolated models for each use case, Nubank has developed\
    \ a centralized AI platform where teams can access pretrained foundation models.\
    \ These models are trained on massive volumes of user transaction data and are\
    \ stored in a shared model repository.\n\nTeams across the company can choose\
    \ between two types of models based on their needs:\n\n- Embedding-only models,\
    \ which use the user representation generated from transaction sequences.\n- Blended\
    \ models, which combine these embeddings with structured tabular features using\
    \ the joint fusion architecture.\n\nThis flexibility is critical.\n\nSome teams\
    \ may already have strong tabular models in place and can plug in the user embeddings\
    \ with minimal changes. Others may prefer to rely entirely on the transformer-based\
    \ sequence model, especially for new tasks where historical tabular features are\
    \ not yet defined.\n\nThe architecture is also forward-compatible with new data\
    \ sources. While the current models are primarily trained on transactions, the\
    \ design allows for the inclusion of other user interaction data, such as app\
    \ usage patterns, customer support chats, or browsing behavior.\n\nIn short, Nubank’s\
    \ system is not just a technical proof-of-concept. It is a production-ready solution\
    \ that delivers measurable gains across core financial prediction tasks.\n\n**References:**\n\

    Gen Alpha are shaping culture early through strong influence on family purchases
    and a growing sense of autonomy. They are spending more time offline, favoring
    real-world activities and physical toys, and showing greater interest in collaborative
    and creative gaming like Roblox, which has doubled in use since 2021. Girls are
    aiming higher in careers like law and medicine, but fewer boys believe they can
    do anything, revealing a growing confidence gap. Social media use is increasingly
    passive, with kids scrolling more and posting less, while influencer marketing
    is overtaking traditional advertising, even for food choices. Despite not holding
    the purse strings, many Gen Alpha kids, especially 8-11-year-olds, have decision-making

    AI companions on platforms like Character.AI, Replika, and CHAI have created new
    digital social spaces where 72% of teens have tried them for chatting, emotional
    support, role-playing, entertainment, and advice. Teens use AI companions because
    they find them entertaining, are curious about the technology, value their constant
    availability, and appreciate the nonjudgmental interaction that lets them share
    things they wouldn''t tell friends or family. Many platforms allow easy access
    for users as young as 13. However, one-third of teens report feeling uncomfortable

    Due to a growing hunger for truth and confidence, consumers are turning to brands
    that can offer credible guidance and emotional support in a time of deep uncertainty.
    Traditional networks of trust, like family, community, and journalism, have weakened,
    creating space for AI to act as a surrogate source of authority, offering recommendations
    that often sound empathetic and informed. This shift raises the importance of
    consistent brand messaging across digital environments, where large language models
    are shaping public narratives based on the content they find.

    while Featured snippets dropped from 15.41% to 5.53%. Sitelinks saw the largest
    gain, rising from 8.44% to 84.95%, likely due to changes in how Google displays
    Scroll-to Sitelinks. Other features that declined sharply include Shopping, Paid

    Instagram is testing a feature that shows like counts for each individual frame

    the like button, offering more detailed engagement insights, though not guaranteed
    to reflect frame-specific intent. This update follows Instagram''s ongoing focus
    on carousels, which tend to outperform single-image posts due to higher interaction

    Kraft Heinz stands out by hijacking cultural moments. It partners with figures

    and generates billions of earned impressions. The company taps into brand, cultural,

    fast, iterative collaboration. By listening to consumers and reacting quickly,
    such as with A1''s meme or Jet-Puffed''s egg carton packaging, it drives both

    Codecademy''s move from free to freemium worked by identifying core user needs
    and segmenting features between free and paid tiers. The team focused on smooth
    onboarding and consistent content to build trust. Early growth tactics included
    user research, referral incentives, and clear KPIs like engagement and course
    completion. Success came from ongoing iteration, experienced hires, and community
    investment.

    Brands use their internal data to create original content that sparks cultural
    conversations and builds authority. e.l.f. Beauty turned corporate board data
    into a viral campaign that challenged representation norms. OkCupid shared insights
    on dating behaviors to establish itself as an expert. Spotify''s Wrapped personalizes
    listening data for social sharing, while Grubhub links food preferences to voting
    patterns for timely political content. This strategy drives organic reach and
    media attention that competitors cannot copy.

    Press mentions are powerful for securing placement in AI search results, so journalist
    request platforms remain popular. Qwoted offers the most media requests, with
    70% of placements from DR 80+ sites. Twitter and LinkedIn share 82% of outlets,
    making monitoring both redundant. HARO has high platform overlap, but many low-quality
    requests come from sites with DR under 10. SOS provides the highest share of follow
    links at 36%, making it ideal for SEO.

    AI''s greatest value to content strategists lies in streamlining the entire content
    lifecycle, not just writing. Tools like Brandwatch and Sprinklr detect emerging
    keywords and sentiment shifts, while predictive engines flag hidden segments and
    churn risks from CRM and behavioral data. Repurposing platforms such as Descript
    and Repurpose.io atomize webinars into video clips, resize them for each platform,
    and help maintain message consistency across the funnel.

    Social platforms track user locations through passive signals like GPS, accelerometers,
    and metadata, even when users do not share their location explicitly. This data
    fuels powerful ad tools, including geofencing, behavioral interest targeting,
    and real-time campaign optimization. For example, a competing venue can target
    people who attended your events by serving ads to users interested in nightlife
    within a 15-mile radius. As your customers post photos, tag your location, and
    RSVP to events, their activity helps build interest graphs that competitors can
    access through ad filters.

    MMM is the top choice for 34% of large advertisers when making decisions. 80%
    of MMM users apply it for both strategic planning and tactical ad spend optimization.
    Advertisers use an average of 4 measurement tools, with only 3% relying on MMM
    alone and 51% combining it with other models. Conflicting results from tools are
    common, so 55% use calibration techniques to improve accuracy. While most still
    outsource MMM, 31% now manage it in-house for transparency, customization, and
    cost savings.

    Software companies should evaluate their payments maturity across three stages:
    enablement, customer value creation, and monetization. Moving from customer value
    creation to monetization requires specialized payments expertise, strategic integration,
    and data intelligence. Companies can generate revenue by participating in card
    economics, engaging directly in funds flow, and monetizing their platform''s network
    and payment speed as value-added services.

    Attackers launched a "Scavenger" supply chain attack in July that hijacked popular
    npm packages, including "is" (2.8 million weekly downloads), through phishing
    from a typosquatted domain (npnjs.org). The malware installed cross-platform JavaScript
    backdoors with persistent command channels on Windows, macOS, and Linux, affecting
    users who updated to infected versions. Exploiting high-privilege maintainer accounts,
    attackers could compromise thousands of companies, with malware mostly undetected
    by antivirus solutions on VirusTotal.

    Agentic AI unlocks a powerful utility for emulating the methodology of advanced
    cloud pentesters or threat actors in a context-aware method that goes beyond traditional
    automated tooling. This post demonstrates how an agent can be provided with “tools”
    or functions that it can utilize first to enumerate the permissions a given IAM
    user has, iteratively identify privilege escalation exploits, and then use other
    tools to carry out the privilege escalation. The post also includes a scenario
    in which the agent successfully discovers the full attack chain that an adversary
    could use to launch an S3 ransomware attack.

    Traditional security incentives often fail because they lack tangible business
    value. Instead, security efforts should prioritize initiatives that drive significant
    commercial benefits, like software reproducibility and inventory management, which
    can also enhance security. Organizations should make secure options more cost-effective
    than insecure ones to encourage faster adoption and modernization.

    This post divides cyber deception into 5 levels: pre-deception, where an organization
    does not employ cyber deception; experimental, where an organization deploys simple
    deception that only succeeds at catching automated scanners; operational, where
    an organization can catch human threats; strategic, where an organization''s deception
    resources mimic authentic resources and mimic high-value targets; and optimized,
    where deception goes beyond detection and shapes adversary behavior. Each level

    This is a guide on cloud logging best practices for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
    It emphasizes the importance of balancing security, compliance, and cost when
    selecting logging strategies. The guide distinguishes between control plane logging
    (default for management) and data plane logging (which requires manual activation
    for service activities), categorizing logs into audit, compute, network, secrets,
    storage, database, and Kubernetes types. Organizations should prioritize logging
    based on business, regulatory, and security needs, avoiding the costly "log everything"
    approach.

    Don''t rely solely on CVSS scores for prioritizing vulnerabilities, as only 17%
    of critical ones are exploited, while attackers target lower scores. Organizations
    should implement Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM) that includes threat
    intelligence, asset importance, business context, and metrics like EPSS. Research
    shows EPSS prioritization targets 3% of vulnerabilities with 65% effectiveness,
    unlike CVSS, which requires 57% coverage for similar results, with only 4% effectiveness.

    [**Why You Should Be Testing Your Detection Rules (7 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fv22bis.medium.com%2Fwhy-you-should-be-testing-your-detection-rules-part-1-ab6f74fc5116%3Futm_source=tldrinfosec/1/01000198324621d1-7b6d9760-b60c-4dc4-9cc6-34fbd7e84a38-000000/Gn8jyUYNqadQtzzx-eib_YIZAxgX9f4NBYIiWtSrZp8=414)


    Conducting detection engineering rules testing helps identify bugs early in the
    pipeline and enables the development of higher-quality rules more quickly. These
    tests can be categorized into unit testing/linting, where individual functions
    are verified and style standards are maintained; integration testing, which assesses
    all components of the pipeline; and end-to-end testing, where an event is triggered
    in production to observe the rule''s behavior. Beginning with unit testing/linting
    and integration testing allows teams to gain the majority of testing benefits
    without the need to maintain complex testing environments.

    While testing an enterprise application for SSRF vulnerabilities, the authors
    of this post discovered a new technique that allowed them to retrieve the complete
    request chain. The attack involved utilizing a redirect loop that returned HTTP
    responses between 300 and 310 before redirecting to the final SSRF location. It
    was found that the application responded with a 200 status, allowing the entire
    chain to be executed, and thus enabling them to exfiltrate cloud credentials.

    Effective poster design follows two simple rules: use distinctive brand elements
    that light and non-brand buyers recognize, and make those brand signals large
    enough to be seen, especially by viewers passing quickly. Many praised minimalist
    outdoor ads succeed only because they get these basics right, while others fail
    by making branding unclear or too small. Research shows strong brand presence
    greatly improves recall. Simple, clear branding wins in limited attention environments,

    [**GENIUS Act is helping Ethereum have its moment (2 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Flinks.tldrnewsletter.com%2FhjukNe/1/01000198321370ef-1f4612bc-efb7-4cf6-b6b1-a84fbcb59022-000000/pbO-IjzDPYfEWk8sBd7K-EJ1MU1MD8IZkDyjIEQ2e3k=414)


    Ethereum is "having its moment" following President Trump''s signing of the GENIUS
    Act, which legalizes fully-backed stablecoins and cements ETH''s role as their
    primary settlement rail. ETH is up ~45% in two weeks, sparked by surging ETF inflows,
    increased institutional portfolio allocation, and fintech demand for operational
    ETH. This is a structural "blockchain financial services cycle," not a boom-bust
    crypto phase, with Ethereum positioned as core infrastructure for stablecoins,
    tokenized assets, and real-world adoption.

    Crypto investment products saw record inflows of \$4.39 billion last week, the
    highest weekly figure ever recorded by CoinShares, pushing 2025''s year-to-date
    total to \$27 billion. Ethereum led the increase with \$2.12 billion of inflows,
    its 13th straight week of gains, outpacing Bitcoin''s \$2.2 billion and setting
    a new personal weekly record. U.S. funds dominated with \$4.36 billion in flows,
    while altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Sui also saw notable inflows, underscoring
    widening investor risk appetite across the sector.

    Aave DAO has approved the Kraken-backed Ink Foundation to launch a rebranded,
    white-label version of Aave V3 on the Ink Layer 2 chain. The vote passed overwhelmingly,
    with 99.8% in favor, enabling Aave to enter the institutional lending space while
    Ink commits to driving over \$250 million in initial liquidity through liquidity
    mining programs. In return, Aave will receive at least 5% of the interest on the
    borrow volume as revenue and gain exclusivity over Ink''s lending integrations
    for 12 months.

    Charles Schwab plans to launch spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading "sometime soon"
    to capture the estimated 1-2% of client crypto holdings currently held at digital-native
    firms like Coinbase. CEO Rick Wurster explicitly stated the company aims to compete
    against crypto exchanges. Schwab clients already own over 20% of the crypto ETP
    market – about \$25 billion out of \$10.8 trillion total assets – but want to
    consolidate their holdings. The company is seeing 400% increased traffic to its
    crypto website as evidence of demand. The move follows improved regulatory clarity
    after the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve rescinded restrictive post-FTX guidelines,
    aligning with broader institutional trends showing 83% of investors planning to
    increase crypto allocations in 2025.

    The passage of three major crypto bills within 24 hours – the GENIUS Act, CLARITY
    Act, and Anti-CBDC Bill – represents the most consequential moment in financial
    services law since Dodd-Frank in 2010, setting the stage for the biggest transformation
    in financial technology since the 1970s digitization era. The GENIUS Act creates
    an entirely new category of financial institution for regulated USD-backed stablecoins,
    while the CLARITY Act clarifies SEC vs CFTC oversight and enables tokenized securities,
    collectively unleashing adoption by banks and Fortune 500 companies. When assets
    are "wrapped" in this new technology, they become default global, instant/24-7,
    and programmable, replacing today''s locked and closed systems. Major banks like
    JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are already positioning themselves to capitalize
    on both the threat and opportunity.

    A common altcoin treasury scheme involves micro-cap public companies raising large
    sums from insiders to buy locked altcoins, which are then marketed as treasury
    assets. The low-float stock pumps on the news, allowing early investors to ride
    a near risk-free trade backed by the underlying asset''s NAV. Retail often buys
    at inflated valuations, unaware that insiders may be unloading months later when
    lockups expire, a cycle repeated across multiple tickers during bullish conditions.


    [**Late-Cycle Market Strategy (60 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Flinks.tldrnewsletter.com%2FAqvCW8/1/01000198321370ef-1f4612bc-efb7-4cf6-b6b1-a84fbcb59022-000000/P7RKUgrG2MWJKtNCID6tlDWhsh3__mqj_Pb2VXaN0U4=414)


    A recent analysis explored a late-cycle investment strategy that draws parallels
    between market tops and poker tournament endgames, advocating for a "push/fold"
    approach where investors protect the bulk of their capital by cashing out while
    concentrating remaining exposure into selective, high-conviction bets. The strategy,
    grounded in Nash equilibrium game theory, aims to counter typical behavioral biases
    like FOMO and greed that lead investors to remain overexposed at cycle peaks,
    with historical examples from the dot-com bubble and 2008 financial crisis validating
    this capital preservation approach. Investors can avoid catastrophic losses during
    market downturns while retaining upside potential by reducing overall exposure
    while maintaining limited participation through calculated high-risk positions.

    Datadog observed a ~20% increase in memory usage after upgrading to Go 1.24, traced
    to a regression in the mallocgc allocator, where large pointer-heavy allocations
    caused more virtual memory to be committed to physical RAM, even though Go''s
    internal metrics remained stable. Collaborating with the Go community, it pinpointed
    the issue, validated a fix to be included in Go 1.25, and found that Go 1.24''s
    Swiss Tables ultimately reduced memory usage in high-traffic environments, delivering
    a net win.

    Three.js instancing can be used to render multiple 3D objects efficiently without

    The pg_search extension for Postgres uses a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree for
    faster write throughput, but this broke Postgres'' physical replication due to
    its Write-Ahead Log (WAL) shipping mechanism. The key to fixing this was making
    sure of atomic logging of operations, addressing the issue that Postgres locks
    aren''t replayed on replica servers, and implementing a Copy-on-Write strategy

    A Ruby developer spent months solving a notorious slow installation problem with
    the rdkafka gem, which took 60-90 seconds to compile from source during each installation.
    The solution involved creating precompiled native extensions with static linking

    After five years at Vercel, Lee Robieson reflects on his growth from individual
    contributor to VP as the company scaled from 30 people and \$1M ARR to 650 people
    and over \$200M ARR. He learned to work intensely while setting clear boundaries,
    pushed teams to move faster through aggressive deadlines, scaled through strategic
    hiring and delegation, avoided "swooping and pooping" by staying involved in important
    decisions from the start, and was willing to change his mind and give up control
    as the organization matured.

    Philip Su was a Meta Distinguished Engineer. He says that achieving rapid career
    progression often requires sacrificing work-life balance and prioritizing hard
    work. For example, he would sleep at the office when young to push code faster.
    This is part of having grit, which often translates to working longer hours and

    A visual approach to document retrieval, using images of pages instead of traditional
    OCR and parsing methods, is a possible method to improve accuracy and preserve
    context for document parsing. This company divides document images into patches
    and uses vision transformers and language models to understand both textual and
    visual elements. By treating documents as visual objects, they are able to have
    higher accuracy in document understanding and search compared to traditional methods,
    especially for complex documents with charts, tables, and diagrams.

    Lumafield investigated the recent recall of over one million Anker PowerCore 10000
    power banks using industrial CT scanning. It identified variations in battery
    cell suppliers and internal assembly, specifically noting differences in tab bus
    bar connections between recalled and non-recalled devices, suggesting potential
    short-circuiting risks in the former. The updated Anker PowerCore 10000 model

    This dev discovered a bug in Google Chrome that allowed MV3 extensions to bypass
    the intended restrictions on `webRequestBlocking`, a feature necessary for adblockers
    that Google was phasing out. The bug exploited a loophole in how Chrome handled
    WebView IDs within the `webRequest` API, allowing extensions to spoof permissions
    and reinstate the blocking functionality.

    A performance issue in the Granola note-taking app was caused by animating the
    `height` property in a CSS audio visualizer. Animating `height` triggers expensive
    layout, paint, and composite steps in the browser''s rendering pipeline. To fix
    this, Granola replaced the `height` animation with a `transform` animation using
    two rectangles, achieving the visual effect of stretching without the performance
    hit.

    Faire completed a massive migration from React class components and MobX to functional
    components and hooks in 2025, despite hooks being released in 2019. The company
    delayed the migration after switching to MobX in 2018, but by 2022, its codebase
    had grown 5x larger while the team only doubled, creating maintainability issues
    with bloated "kitchen-sink" classes and performance problems from large bundle

    This dev had to build a web application for users in Africa with poor internet
    infrastructure, mostly using feature phones with 240px screens and EDGE connections.
    They established strict constraints, including a 128KB total page budget, compatibility
    with Opera Mini browser, and responsive design from feature phones to 4K displays.
    Despite the extreme limitations, these tight constraints led to better solutions:
    they used system fonts instead of web fonts, built a minimal custom library called
    "Whizz" instead of heavy frameworks, and created an efficient AJAX-based navigation
    system that only loaded new page content rather than full page reloads.

    LinkedIn has overtaken X as the top social platform for journalists in 2025, making
    it the most effective place for PR professionals to build relationships. Despite
    some rise in DM-based outreach, 96% of journalists still prefer to receive pitches
    via email. Journalists now value exclusives more than original research and prioritize
    access to credible sources over story ideas or data. Irrelevant pitches are increasing,
    with 47% of journalists saying they seldom receive relevant outreach, and response
    rates continue to decline as pitch volumes rise. With ongoing layoffs and more
    journalists moving to independent platforms like Substack, PR professionals must

    appears in the results (3 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org%2Fshort-reads%2F2025%2F07%2F22%2Fgoogle-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results%2F%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/tOwUsbuUIJGPrJ4u_9yuFQzOo25h86Vkyo6B0O5GQjU=415)


    Users are less likely to click on links when Google shows an AI-generated summary,
    with only 8% clicking on a search result compared to 15% when no summary appears.
    Just 1% of visits to AI summary pages result in users clicking links within the
    summary itself. About 26% of users end their browsing after seeing a summary,
    compared to 16% for pages without one. Longer and question-based searches are
    more likely to trigger an AI summary, with 60% of question-word searches and 53%
    of 10-word-or-longer searches producing one.


    # **Strategies & Tactics**


    [**The Case for Zero-Click Content in a Zero-Trust Ecosystem (4 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fsparktoro.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-case-for-zero-click-content-in-a-zero-trust-ecosystem%2F%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/aQIMel5gnDB3tCW-ZnPojIKUn9_WFJI41QTvkDRwaiQ=415)


    Platforms now suppress outbound links, hide referral data, and hoard traffic.
    This makes traditional click-based marketing unreliable. Instead of chasing clicks,
    zero-click content delivers standalone value directly in-platform. Links aren''t
    off-limits but should be used sparingly, supported by consistent value-driven
    content. Success can be measured through branded search lift, audience growth,
    and conversions like booked demos.


    [**The Power of Identity: Building Lifelong Customers (10 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.socialmediaexaminer.com%2Fthe-power-of-identify-building-lifelong-customers%2F%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/ud8Fq8640gK7yi1XsJe3UiTeiex3g9ZIkZdVZKTBAe4=415)


    The strongest loyalty comes from brands that reflect how customers define themselves
    and what they care about most. Identity marketing involves researching how customers
    talk about their struggles and aspirations, validating those themes through real-world
    feedback, and naming identity groups with deeper meaning rather than surface-level
    slogans. When customers feel that a brand helps express who they are and what
    they believe in, they become voluntary ambassadors who spread the message out
    of pride and alignment, not obligation.


    [**Passionate employee > Faceless logo (1 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fthatjillian_for-the-love-of-all-that-is-holy-brands-activity-7354189967004188672-us2S%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/P3tpWHKf5nZJAFNDqUl9IpPCg-D6ffvF4L-1c6IXjXc=415)


    Instead of prioritizing your company LinkedIn page, identify a charismatic employee
    to serve as your public voice. People trust individuals far more than brand logos,
    and employee-led content builds a stronger audience connection. Ideal candidates
    often have public speaking experience, creative backgrounds, or represent underrepresented
    groups. Support them with a ghostwriter, feature them on your company page, put
    them on stages, and compensate them accordingly.


    # **Resources & Tools**


    [**ChatGPT uses Google SERP Snippets for its Answers (6 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.aleydasolis.com%2Fen%2Fai-search%2Fchatgpt-uses-google-serp-snippets-for-answers%2F%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/pubNrmUeCQrEwzbyGLEnWxbLDNRgl0JL2f05l6xCANI=415)


    A test confirmed that ChatGPT relies on Google Search result snippets for its
    answers. A newly published webpage, not submitted to search engines, couldn''t
    be located by ChatGPT even with web search enabled. Gemini, in contrast, fetched
    the live content directly. Once the page was indexed in Google but not yet visible
    in search results, ChatGPT still failed to access it. Only after the page appeared
    in Google SERPs did ChatGPT provide a partial response, clearly drawn from the
    Google snippet rather than the actual page. This shows ChatGPT''s dependence on
    Google''s indexed summaries, not direct page access.


    [**When using AI bots turns customers away (3 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fapp.sciencesays.com%2Fp%2Fwhen-using-ai-bots-turns-customers-away%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/JdNy3Ws0pwtFssaxVrsUmghpWI8zZU7OONOriuQ4Gms=415)


    Customers are 23.7% less likely to continue using a service when it is provided
    by AI instead of a human if warmth is important. The drop in preference is stronger
    when the service is associated with fun or pleasure, with a 29.8% decrease in
    usage intention, compared to 17.5% when the focus is on efficiency. AI is perceived
    as 19.5% less warm than human staff, but using informal language helps reduce
    this effect. Companies like Henn na Hotel and McDonald''s abandoned full AI setups
    due to poor customer response, while hybrid models like Starbucks'' app chatbot
    have been more successful.

    [**Slack''s acquisition spree: 6 purchases in 6 years to compete with Microsoft
    and Google (3 minute read)**](https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fstrategybreakdowns.com%2Fp%2Fslackquisitions%3Futm_source=tldrmarketing/1/01000198414df1b8-4124cbc1-b208-4f6e-aec1-b428be597199-000000/nckpF3w3AJ5siNpVIQQd_Yfn-BvSGdBIhAgA_JD28GM=415)


    Slack used a buy-over-build strategy to quickly match the features of Microsoft
    and Google by acquiring six companies between 2014 and 2020. These acquisitions
    helped it add tools like screen sharing, document collaboration, and email integration,
    allowing it to scale to 12 million daily active users by the end of 2020. Its
    2018 deal with Atlassian eliminated competitors HipChat and Stride and led to
    over 11 joint integrations. By acquiring technologies that reduced context-switching,
    Slack positioned itself as a unified work hub and ultimately attracted Salesforce,
    which acquired it in 2020.


    [**What explains Google''s record quarterly search revenue while clicks decline

    The introduction of AI Overviews has changed the search funnel by addressing early
    research queries without requiring user clicks. As a result, fewer users proceed
    to external sites, but those who do are more likely to convert and are being monetized
    at higher rates, with CPCs rising nearly 13%. This model has enabled Google to
    grow search revenue significantly despite reduced traffic to third-party websites.

**2. Superposition Meets Production—A Guide for AI Engineers**
_Date:_ July 17, 2025
_Key Finding:_ This newsletter delves into the current landscape and future prospects of quantum computing for AI applications, featuring insights from DeepMind veteran Jennifer Prendki. It highlights that while universal quantum computers are still some years away, specific quantum applications for machine learning are emerging today, particularly in recommendation systems, financial applications (e.g., fraud detection), and pharmaceuticals. A significant challenge is the lack of a mature "QMLOps" software layer, as the quantum computing stack is fragmented and primitive compared to classical ML infrastructure. The "no-cloning theorem" fundamentally alters data operations in quantum environments, requiring a shift to on-demand regeneration of quantum states rather than traditional backups or reproducibility. The newsletter also discusses how quantum computing enables new paradigms like Topological Data Analysis and emphasizes the need for "bridge talent" in engineering rather than deep quantum physics expertise for practitioners.
