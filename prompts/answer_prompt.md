    \n[Ben Lorica ÁΩóÁëûÂç°](https://substack.com/@gradientflow)\n\nJul 29\n\n# **The Next\
    \ Generation of AI Agents: Large Action Models Explained**\n\nAs AI agents become\
    \ commonplace in enterprise workflows, teams are discovering the limitations of\
    \ building task-specific automated systems from scratch. **Large Action Models\
    \ (LAMs)** represent the foundational layer that transforms how we build agents‚Äîproviding\
    \ the general-purpose perception, planning, and execution capabilities that individual\
    \ agents can leverage rather than reinvent. Instead of building isolated automation\
    \ tools, LAMs enable teams to create more capable, adaptable agentic systems that\
    \ can operate across diverse contexts and applications.\n\n**LAMs** represent\
    \ a shift in AI from passive content generation to active task execution. Unlike\
    \ **Large Language Models** (LLMs) that excel at text generation and understanding,\
    \ or **Visual Language Models** (VLMs) that combine text and visual processing,\
    \ LAMs are designed to autonomously perceive, plan, and execute multi-step actions\
    \ within digital and physical environments. While AI **agents** are able to perform\
    \ specific automated tasks, **LAMs serve as foundational architecture** that enable\
    \ **more general-purpose**, language-driven agentic systems capable of operating\
    \ across diverse contexts and applications.\n\nThe core distinction lies in their\
    \ operational approach. While LLMs can describe flight booking and VLMs can analyze\
    \ booking screenshots, LAMs actually navigate websites and complete reservations.\
    \ _That said, current implementations work best in controlled environments._ Many\
    \ LAMs achieve this capability by pairing neural perception modules with symbolic\
    \ planners in a neuro‚Äësymbolic architecture, though some [recent systems rely\
    \ on a single end‚Äëto‚Äëend](https://substack.com/redirect/080a2d86-05cc-427d-8e55-8a51506788dc?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\

    \ launched in July 2025, represents the first major production deployment of a\
    \ unified LAM system. By combining web browsing capabilities, deep research functionality,\
    \ and terminal access within a single model, ChatGPT agent demonstrates how LAMs\
    \ can move beyond controlled environments to handle complex, multi-step workflows\
    \ across diverse applications. The system achieved state-of-the-art performance\
    \ on benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam (41.6% accuracy) and FrontierMath (27.4%\
    \ accuracy), while maintaining the safety controls necessary for enterprise deployment.\n\
    \nIn the case of [**ChatGPT agent**](https://substack.com/redirect/854dfb0f-c30d-4d4f-8c1e-ab6b495b9a72?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\

    \ which handle tasks like ordering meals or booking rides. _However, early implementations\
    \ show mixed real-world results._\n\nThis same power is being applied to streamline\
    \ business operations. Within the enterprise, ServiceNow agents automate internal\
    \ IT and HR workflows, while specialized tools like [11x‚Äôs \"Alice\"](https://substack.com/redirect/b14cf4e1-c583-4385-b496-36121337cd02?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\

    \ are emerging to automate complex knowledge work within specific applications,\
    \ such as performing multi-step data modeling and analysis in Microsoft Excel.\n\
    \nThe release of [ChatGPT agent](https://substack.com/redirect/854dfb0f-c30d-4d4f-8c1e-ab6b495b9a72?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ marks a significant milestone in LAM maturity, offering the first widely-available\
    \ unified system that consolidates multiple capabilities. Unlike earlier specialized\
    \ tools, ChatGPT agent integrates visual web browsing, text-based research, terminal\
    \ access, and API connectivity within a single model. This architectural approach\
    \ enables seamless transitions between different interaction modes‚Äîgathering calendar\
    \ information through an API, analyzing web content via text processing, and completing\
    \ transactions through visual interface manipulation.\n\nFor development teams,\
    \ this represents a shift from integrating multiple specialized agents to leveraging\
    \ a foundational LAM that can adapt its approach based on task requirements. The\
    \ system's ability to generate editable artifacts (presentations, spreadsheets,\

    \ coordinate teams of agents on complex programming projects. In data-intensive\
    \ sectors such as healthcare and finance, these models reduce administrative burdens\
    \ by managing patient scheduling and insurance claims, or enhance security and\
    \ compliance by performing real-time fraud analysis and automating regulatory\
    \ filings. From controlling industrial robots on a manufacturing floor to navigating\
    \ websites and desktop applications, LAMs provide the foundational capability\
    \ for a new era of digital and physical automation.\n\n#### Navigating the Large\
    \ Action Model Landscape\n\nThe LAM landscape has crystallized around production\
    \ viability, with [ChatGPT agent](https://substack.com/redirect/854dfb0f-c30d-4d4f-8c1e-ab6b495b9a72?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ establishing a new benchmark for unified agentic systems. OpenAI's decision\
    \ to sunset the standalone Operator tool in favor of the integrated agent approach\
    \ signals industry convergence toward comprehensive LAM platforms rather than\
    \ specialized tools.\n\nFor enterprise teams evaluating LAM adoption, this consolidation\
    \ simplifies the decision matrix. Instead of choosing between separate browsing,\
    \ research, and automation tools, teams can now leverage unified systems that\
    \ handle multi-modal interactions. The performance metrics from ChatGPT agent‚Äîincluding\
    \ 45.5% accuracy on spreadsheet tasks and 68.9% on web research benchmarks‚Äîprovide\

    \ The conversation often turns to whether we're witnessing a true paradigm shift\
    \ in autonomy or just a more sophisticated, and perhaps brittle, form of tool-chaining\
    \ wrapped in new marketing.\n\nThe reality is that most LAM implementations today\
    \ work well in narrow, well-defined scenarios but struggle with the unpredictability\

    \ knowledge work automation‚Äîcompetitive analysis, financial modeling, and presentation\
    \ generation‚Äîwhere the agent's ability to combine research and artifact creation\
    \ provides immediate value. However, the 400 messages per month limit for Pro\
    \ users and 40 for other tiers indicates that even production LAMs require usage\
    \ management as organizations scale adoption.\n\nChatGPT agent‚Äôs integration of\
    \ safety controls‚Äîincluding explicit user confirmation for consequential actions\
    \ and 'Watch Mode' for critical tasks like email sending‚Äîaddresses enterprise\
    \ concerns about autonomous systems. These controls represent a pragmatic approach\
    \ to LAM deployment that prioritizes user oversight while enabling automation\
    \ of routine workflows.\n\nAs LAMs become more viable, security-conscious organizations\
    \ will likely mirror their early cloud adoption playbook when approaching LAMs,\
    \ proceeding with the same caution that defined their initial cloud strategies.\
    \ The expanded attack surface concerns are real‚Äîwhen you give an AI system the\
    \ ability to act on your behalf across multiple applications, you're essentially\
    \ handing over the keys to your digital kingdom. Meanwhile, the job displacement\
    \ anxiety is palpable in customer service and administrative roles, though my\
    \ sense is that teams who frame LAMs as augmentation rather than replacement tend\
    \ to have much smoother adoption experiences.\n\n#### Development Priorities for\
    \ Enterprise-Ready LAMs\n\nSo, where do we go from here? ChatGPT agent's deployment\
    \ reveals the next phase of LAM development priorities. Usage constraints (40-400\
    \ messages monthly) highlight the need for efficiency optimizations that maximize\
    \ task completion within limited interactions. The system's functionality, while\
    \ promising, shows that artifact generation requires significant refinement to\
    \ match professional standards.\n\nEnterprise adoption will drive requirements\
    \ for enhanced security controls, audit trails, and compliance frameworks. The\
    \ system's current biological risk safeguards and prompt injection protections\
    \ establish baseline security expectations that future LAMs must meet or exceed.\n\

    \n#### Implementation Lessons from ChatGPT Agent\n\nEarly deployments of ChatGPT\
    \ agent provide concrete insights for teams planning LAM integration:\n\n- **Architecture\
    \ Decisions**: The unified model approach (combining browsing, research, and terminal\
    \ access) proves more effective than microservice architectures for user experience,\
    \ despite increased complexity in safety controls and resource management.\n-\
    \ **Usage Patterns**: Real-world usage gravitates toward knowledge work automation‚Äîresearch\
    \ synthesis, document generation, and data analysis‚Äîrather than transactional\
    \ web interactions. This suggests LAM implementation should prioritize content\
    \ creation workflows over e-commerce automation.\n- **Safety-Performance Trade-offs**:\
    \ The explicit confirmation requirements for consequential actions create friction\
    \ but enable enterprise adoption. Teams implementing LAMs should plan for approval\
    \ workflows that balance automation benefits with organizational risk tolerance.\n\
    - **Integration Strategies**: The connector framework (Gmail, GitHub integration)\
    \ demonstrates how LAMs can extend existing business applications rather than\
    \ replacing them. This integration-first approach reduces deployment complexity\
    \ while maximizing organizational value.\n\n¬© 2025 Gradient Flow  \n548 Market\

    System design and proper software engineering are required for building effective
    AI agents. Developers need to focus on clear instructions, lean context management,
    robust tool interfaces, and automated validation loops instead of finding a silver
    bullet of a great prompt or an advanced framework. Error analysis is paramount
    - models should be used to help developers understand where agents fail so that
    those failure modes can be systematically addressed. The goal is to create reliable
    and recoverable agents that fail gracefully and can be improved iteratively.

    Getting value from data is still incredibly hard, making data businesses terrible
    VC investments. Auren Hoffman predicted exponential demand, but fewer than 100
    hedge funds buy alternative data today. After 1,000 SaaS unicorns, there''s been
    one DaaS unicorn: ZoomInfo, which never took VC. Data companies grow slowly with
    predictable revenue - perfect for PE, not VCs needing explosive growth.

    \ subsidiary IEIT‚Äôs product pictured below). As Erica Zhao reports for Leiphone,\
    \ the market for these all-in-one machines has significantly cooled.\n\n[![ÂÖÉËÑë‰ºÅÊô∫DeepSeek‰∏Ä‰ΩìÊú∫Êé®Âá∫‚ÄúÂèåÊ®°‚ÄùÁâà](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ld2W!,w_438,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52e5be73-645b-4288-9507-09b1a30a46d4_800x711.jpeg\

    \nThis IEIT all-in-one machine supports DeepSeek‚Äôs 671B ‚Äúfull-parameter‚Äù model\n\
    \n**Key Takeaways: Since the frenzy of reports about fast and wide DeepSeek deployment,\
    \ these all-in-one machines have not diffused past early adopters and attracted\
    \ few repeat customers.**\n\n- From the article: ‚Äú*Leiphone asked many industry\
    \ insiders, and the answers were all negative. Only one leading complete-system\
    \ vendor had repeat sales ‚Äî repeat purchases for two machines from a research\
    \ institute. ‚ÄòEveryone is wallowing about in the pit where the first batch of\
    \ users landed, and new users are more cautious,‚Äô lamented Jianing, a complete-system\
    \ vendor sales representative.*‚Äù\n- Yang Fei, an all-in-one machine salesperson,\
    \ tells Leiphone that the demand for large-scale deployment has faded. As Zhao\
    \ writes, ‚Äú*At the beginning of March, everyone was still complaining about the\
    \ low conversion rate of business opportunities, but since April, even the business\
    \ opportunities of ‚Äòonly consulting, no orders‚Äô have dropped from hundreds of\
    \ opportunities a day to more than ten. In various WeChat groups, it became rare\
    \ to see users asking and discussing all-in-one machines..*.‚Äù\n\n**What happened?\
    \ Let‚Äôs go through three factors in turn: 1) the gap between press release and\
    \ actual adaptation; 2) barriers to fine-tuning with local data; 3) disregard\
    \ for ROI amidst initial deployments**\n\n1. Deployment takes time! It can take\
    \ months to conduct reliability testing, perform on-site debugging, and educate\
    \ clients. As Zhao writes, ‚Äú*In the overwhelming and bustling news of ‚Äòxx all-in-one\
    \ machine and xx application have completed adaptation‚Äô some time ago, there is\
    \ also a lot of watered-down content. This is a common trial-and-error strategy\
    \ in the industry - after reaching a deal, advertise first‚Ä¶and then truly adapt,\
    \ customize development and deploy according to user needs*.‚Äù Please, please,\
    \ please: Don‚Äôt take fluffy announcements at face value.\n2. Deployment is also\
    \ very difficult, especially when it comes to integrating application-specific\
    \ data. Consider the case of hospitals. All-in-one machine vendors recounted that\
    \ they would often be called to meetings with hospital leaders and receive no\
    \ questions after their demonstrations. From the article: ‚Äú*(all-in-one machines\
    \ deployed in) large hospitals may not be able to support enough concurrent users;\
    \ and outmoded/backward informatization in small hospitals may become a barrier\
    \ to the entry of all-in-one machines*.‚Äù\n3. The early adopters ‚Äî state-owned\
    \ enterprises and local governments ‚Äî were just just trying to check a box, so\
    \ they could brag that they had adopted DeepSeek. They didn‚Äôt take into account\
    \ whether a full-parameter or distilled version of DeepSeek was better for ROI.\
    \ Also, they didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the software layer. Put simply, this\
    \ is not the ‚Äúfast-acting, seemingly almost biological process‚Äù of diffusion that\
    \ best fits general-purpose technologies, as I have argued **[in my researc](https://substack.com/redirect/484ec0e3-b42c-4925-ad1e-fa2994320fdf?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)h**.\n\
    \   \n   1. Let‚Äôs get even more granular here. If you look at the vendors that\
    \ sold the most all-in-one machines (e.g., H3C and Inspur subsidiary IEIT Systems),\
    \ it‚Äôs the established leaders with *guanxi* connections to the SOEs, financial\
    \ institutions, and other large buyers. Zhao writes, ‚Äú*The crucial moat in the\
    \ all-in-one machine business that the market struggled to figure out in the first\
    \ half of the year turned out to be customer relationships*.‚Äù\n   2. Furthermore,\
    \ why is DeepSeek being spread through a combined software-hardware package, instead\
    \ of sold as a software service? One reason is that the Chinese market doesn‚Äôt\
    \ have [**strong consciousness in paying for software**](https://substack.com/redirect/3239f292-3d70-4e78-ab0d-61db3b0515f1?j=eyJ1IjoiNXM4M296In0.tGNGSdtmlCx12UO5VTFY50vjzjDXKZsMTxKEYVZUdc8)\
    \ (partly due to prevalence of software piracy in the 2000s).\n\n**If all-in-one\
    \ machines do serve as a sustainable route of LLM diffusion in China, it will\
    \ be a slow and steady path.**\n\n- Zhao emphasizes, ‚Äú*There are also real implementation\
    \ cases of all-in-one machines, but this type of implementation requires more\
    \ specific industry models and local deployment combined with user data*.‚Äù\n\n\
    <!--THE END-->\n\n- Huang Zhong, a company leader who has deeply engaged with\
    \ all-in-one machines over the past two years, points out that for many application\
    \ sectors, you need a multi-modal configuration of large models and many different\
    \ small models good at different tasks: ‚ÄúOne Deep Seek is obviously not enough.‚Äù\n\

    China''s two biggest satellite internet networks have deployed less than 1% of

    Building effective AI agents is about system design and proper software engineering.
    Focus on clear instructions, lean context management, robust tool interfaces,
    and automated validation loops. Look for missing tools, unclear prompts, or insufficient
    context when debugging agents. Put error analysis first in the development process
    - let models help understand where the agent failed, then systematically address
    those failure modes. The goal isn''t to create perfect agents but to make reliable
    and recoverable ones that fail gracefully and can be improved iteratively.

    Internet advertising gave us free content and services, and a mostly open Internet.
    That is now collapsing with the advent of AI. Content has now become training
    data for AI, unleashing a whole new wave of crawlers on the web that often offer
    nothing in return. AI companies repurpose the content they ingest and serve it
    directly to users without sending them to the original source, breaking the ad-based
    structure of the Internet. Content creators are rapidly fencing off their gardens,
    putting up paywalls and anti-bot measures so aggressive that users are having

    [**The New Chips Designed to Solve AI''s Energy Problem (6 minute read)**](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/XQIOX3)


    The estimated growth in energy required for AI is currently unsustainable. Several
    startups and companies are experimenting with new kinds of chips that have the
    potential to be much more energy efficient than current industry leaders at the
    all-important task of inference. While Nvidia chips will continue to be used for
    AI training for the foreseeable future, more efficient inference could collectively
    save companies tens of billions of dollars. The intensity of these chip development
    efforts shows how desperate the tech world is to provide AI to customers without
    paying the ''Nvidia tax''.

    A critical security vulnerability (CVE-2025-24000) in the Post SMTP WordPress
    plugin allows low-privileged users to access email logs and hijack administrator
    accounts by intercepting password reset emails. The flaw affects all versions
    up to 3.2.0 and stems from broken access controls that only checked if users were
    logged in without verifying their permission levels. Despite a fix being released
    in version 3.3.0 on June 11, over 200,000 WordPress sites remain vulnerable, as
    more than half of users haven''t updated their plugin.

    Microsoft''s Copilot Enterprise Python sandbox vulnerability allowed researchers
    to gain root access within the container through a PATH hijacking attack in the
    keepAliveJupyterSvc.sh script, which executed \`pgrep\` without a full path every
    2 seconds. Researchers exploited this by placing a malicious script in /app/miniconda/bin,
    which was writable by the ubuntu user and prioritized in $PATH, to execute arbitrary
    commands as root. While container breakout proved impossible due to patching,
    the vulnerability demonstrated how improper PATH handling in privileged scripts
    can lead to privilege escalation even in sandboxed environments.

    OSS-Fuzz-Gen introduced an agent-based LLM approach that automatically generates
    build scripts and fuzzing harnesses for integrating projects into OSS-Fuzz, using
    iterative command execution and environment exploration to handle diverse C/C++
    codebases. The system achieved 88 successful integrations from 225 tested repositories,
    demonstrating its ability to handle complex builds that require custom tools and
    dependencies. Key limitations include build scripts that avoid target source code
    or only support single-harness compilation, requiring post-processing validation
    improvements.

    The emergence of LLMs and coding agents fundamentally transforms application security,
    as AI now both writes and debugs code. As LLMs advance, humans will focus more
    on prioritizing vulnerabilities, providing additional context, and assessing exploitability.
    The vulnerability disclosure process will also become much quicker, with LLMs
    rapidly identifying vulnerabilities and offensive and defensive teams promptly
    collaborating to evaluate exploitability.

    UnMarker is designed to be the first universal attack against defensive watermarking,
    which is used to detect AI-generated deepfakes. The attack disrupts watermarks
    in image spectral amplitudes without requiring detector feedback or knowledge
    of the scheme, thereby defeating both traditional and advanced semantic watermarking
    systems and rendering deepfake detection ineffective.

    Scattered Spider is targeting VMware ESXi hypervisors across retail, airline,
    transportation, and insurance sectors using social engineering to impersonate
    employees and trick IT help desks into resetting passwords for privileged accounts.
    Once they gain vCenter access, attackers enable SSH on ESXi hosts, perform "disk-swap"
    attacks to extract the NTDS.dit Active Directory database, wipe backups, and deploy
    ransomware to encrypt all VMs in the datastores. Google recommends hardening vSphere
    with execInstalledOnly, VM encryption, disabled SSH, phishing-resistant MFA, isolating
    Tier 0 assets, and centralizing logs in a SIEM to detect suspicious vCenter logins

    Chainguard''s Libraries for Python is a secure index that rebuilds Python packages
    and their dependency trees from source within a Supply-chain Levels for Software
    Artifacts (SLSA) Level 2-hardened setup to prevent supply chain threats. The platform
    specifically addresses Python wheels with native code and re-bundled OS libraries,
    such as OpenSSL, which create "software dark matter" that is hidden from SCA scanners.
    Early testing indicates that 98% of known malicious packages would be identified
    and blocked. This development follows notable incidents in 2023 and 2024 that
    involved attacks on PyTorch and Ultralytics YOLO where compromised builds and

    Coinbase is making it easier for retail investors to trade perpetual futures‚Äîhighly
    leveraged crypto contracts that don''t expire. The offering, available through
    its Coinbase Advanced platform, mirrors what''s already common on offshore exchanges
    like Binance and Bybit. While the move could boost trading volumes and revenue,
    it also marks a shift toward riskier products at a time when regulators remain
    cautious about retail access to complex derivatives.

    While some in the U.S. claim that design thinking is dead, criticizing it as redundant
    or damaging, the approach continues to prove its value globally by emphasizing
    human insight, strategic problem-solving, and risk reduction in both commercial
    and public sectors. Rather than being obsolete, design thinking is evolving beyond

    `useCallback` and `useMemo` are often misused, leading to unnecessary complexity
    and overhead without actual performance gains. This article goes over scenarios
    where memoization is pointless, such as when passing props to non-memoized components
    or using props directly as dependencies within `useCallback` or `useEffect`. A

    and their attributes can be styled and animated. This post explains presentational
    attributes like `stroke` and `stroke-dashoffset`, which are useful for creating
    animated effects like drawing shapes. A key concept explained is the `viewBox`
    attribute, which creates an internal coordinate system that allows SVGs to scale
    properly and remain responsive, solving the problem of fixed positioning that
    occurs when using absolute coordinates.

    The best companies avoid direct feature comparisons with competitors and instead
    reframe the conversation by positioning themselves as solving entirely different
    problems. Asana, Superhuman, and ClickUp use analogies that place competitors
    in narrow roles while casting themselves as broader solutions. Good messaging
    defines competitors in small, accurate terms and presents the company as a more
    expansive, transformational option. Use templates like Tool vs. Platform or Past
    vs. Future to build this positioning.

    Reddit is more than an SEO tool. It''s a major data source for LLMs, meaning authentic
    content can shape how AI platforms understand and present your brand. Unlike paid
    ads, Reddit relies on genuine community engagement. Effective use means listening
    first, contributing meaningfully, tracking mentions, and avoiding shortcuts. Companies
    should join existing conversations rather than starting new subreddits and ensure
    someone on the team can engage authentically.

    Webmail providers sort and block emails based on signals like how businesses honor
    unsubscribe requests. If a company uses the same sending address for multiple
    lists and removes a user from only one list, providers like Gmail may see this
    as ignoring an unsubscribe. This can lower sender reputation and push emails to
    spam. Using separate sending addresses, including unsubscribe headers with list
    identifiers, and monitoring Gmail''s Postmaster Tools, can help preserve deliverability
    and trust.

    Nomads.com began as a simple spreadsheet Pieter Levels made to solve his own travel
    challenges as a remote worker. It quickly evolved into a global hub because it
    addressed a real, shared need. Growth happened naturally as users found value
    and contributed their own data. Its success came from usefulness, timing, and

    Marketers should stop treating every product release as a standalone event and
    instead prioritize based on audience impact. Launches should fit into a broader
    narrative, align with company positioning, and be bundled with other updates when
    appropriate. Rather than relying solely on press, teams should activate creators,
    partners, and customers early to build momentum. A checklist is not a strategy.
    Each launch should begin with a clear brief defining goals, audience, and channels.
    Strong internal alignment across product, marketing, and sales is key to validating
    the feature and setting shared metrics.

    Amazon pulled its ads from Google Shopping across all major markets between July
    21 and 23. This included the US, UK, Germany, and Japan, dropping its impression

    ChatGPT appears to use Google''s index and cache to retrieve web content, based
    on tests showing it returns information only from pages submitted to Google. Visibility
    in ChatGPT depends largely on whether a page is indexed. Issues like ‚Äúcrawled
    but not indexed‚Äù are common and not always critical, but improving internal linking
    and creating unique content can help important pages get indexed. For better AI
    visibility, structure content clearly, answer questions directly, use Schema.org

    weekly, monthly, and yearly aggregations. It supports geographic filtering by
    region and subregion. The API improves on the website version by allowing comparisons

    Solana co‚Äëfounder Anatoly Yakovenko labeled memecoins and NFTs ‚Äúdigital slop‚Äù
    with no intrinsic value, comparing them to exploitative loot boxes, prompting
    Base creator Jesse Pollak to counter that the content itself can hold fundamental
    worth. Yakovenko conceded memecoin activity was crucial to Solana''s rise but
    argued it was akin to Apple''s revenues from loot boxes rather than meaningful
    innovation. Data shows memecoins made up 62‚ÄØ% of Solana dApp revenue in June and
    drove roughly \$1.6‚ÄØbillion in H1‚ÄØ2025. Pump.fun and PumpSwap have captured most
    of the market share, though rivals like LetBonk are now challenging their dominance
    in 24‚Äëhour launchpad revenue.

    The rapid growth of Ethereum treasury companies (holding around 0.9% of total
    ETH supply) is a key driver of fresh demand for Ethereum, fueled by corporate
    interest in staking yields. While this model offers potential annual yields of
    3-5%, it introduces liquidity concerns and smart contract risks. Successful adoption
    depends heavily on prudent risk management amid regulatory clarity, stablecoin
    expansion, and asset tokenization.

    The creator economy''s core problem is misaligned economics, while new onchain
    primitives like tips, collectibles, and content coins rebalance flows among creators,
    fans, and platforms. Tipping tools like Noice and Tipn turn engagement into programmable
    micro‚Äëpayments but lack shared upside ‚Äì Farcaster''s 1‚Äëof‚Äë1 collectibles route
    90% of auction proceeds to creators, yet only one collector benefits. Content
    coins pair media with ERC‚Äë20s to reward early belief and scale with distribution,
    though they import memecoin‚Äëstyle speculation that UX choices try to soften. The
    real unlock is programmability and interoperability: tips, collectibles, and coins
    can compose into access, loyalty, and revenue‚Äësharing layers, pointing to a modular
    stack where creators define their own economics and value moves openly across
    the web.

    Solana''s recent onchain activity is propped up by ‚Äúcrime‚Äù‚Äëdriven mechanics like
    bundled tokens, insider trading, and engineered liquidity rather than organic
    demand, masking deteriorating network health. This ‚Äúcrime gap‚Äù parallels historical
    market manipulations like the Sumitomo Copper Affair and is destined to collapse
    once fresh capital inflows wane. As macro pressures mount and artificial supports
    fail, a rapid capital exit will likely ensue, leaving memecoin insiders to extract
    remaining value. Ultimately, the cycle will pendulum back toward utility‚Äëfocused
    projects on more robust chains as raw casino‚Äëstyle speculation loses its late‚Äëcycle
    edge.

    Every DeFi pitch hinges on two questions: ‚ÄúIs this app worth building?‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan

    Repealing the IRS ‚ÄúDeFi Broker Rule,‚Äù passing the GENIUS Act and the Digital Asset

    Policymakers should both acknowledge DeFi''s self‚Äëcustodial, permissionless architecture
    and set clear standards, focusing on three gaps: outcome-based disclosures (how
    it works, what can fail, who controls what, and who''s accountable), control-based
    liability, and pragmatic compliance for self-custodial systems. Existing laws
    can still address fraud, manipulation, and sanctions evasion without compromising
    trustless design. Thoughtful frameworks can make onchain markets safer, more sustainable,

    Aave DAO voted to reduce AAVE token emissions by another 25% while keeping buybacks
    steady, making the protocol even more net token-accretive. Since initiating the
    buyback program, the treasury''s cash reserves have grown 20%, and the DAO now
    holds 66,512 AAVE with a 37.49% unrealized gain. This strengthens long-term sustainability
    and could pave the way for Anti-GHO proposals outlined in Aavenomics.

    Starting later this summer, some Lyft rides in Atlanta will have empty driver‚Äôs
    seats as the rideshare network begins rolling out autonomous vehicles.


    Still, Jeremy Bird, Lyft‚Äôs EVP of driver experience, told Tech Brew that the company
    expects humans to occupy a critical role in the rideshare industry for many years
    to come, especially if hopes that AVs spur industry growth pan out. To help its
    drivers navigate the introduction of this technology into Lyft‚Äôs fleet, the company
    recently kicked off a series of forums inviting drivers to share input.


    ‚ÄúI think the No. 1 pitfall would be to ignore it,‚Äù Bird said. ‚ÄúTo say, ‚ÄòOh, this
    is something that‚Äôs gonna happen 10 years down the road. No need to look over
    here.‚Äô Meanwhile, to be signing deals with autonomous vehicle companies. I don‚Äôt
    think that is fair to drivers.‚Äù

    Tesla‚Äôs rough ride continues.


    The No. 1 US EV maker on Wednesday released a Q2 earnings report that [again](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/y_t?mblid=f58b5dc89d46&mbcid=40858261.396130&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy)

    and backlash to CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs foray into right-wing politics.


    The EV maker reported $1.2 billion in net income, down 16% YoY. Automotive revenues
    fell 16%, as well, while overall revenue was down 12%.


    In an update for investors, the company attributed its falling profits to lower
    revenue from regulatory credits Tesla sells to other automakers, an increase in
    operating expenses, and a decline in vehicle deliveries, among other factors.
    Tesla‚Äôs vehicle deliveries fell 13% YoY in Q2.


    As The Verge [noted](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/Cl5?mblid=ab2922f1df91&mbcid=40858261.396130&mid=858c9b623cc2711c5f02e0f39af85262&mbuuid=1CAffDM1mBsqW8DsMz3ifDsy),
    Tesla is likely to see its revenue from regulatory credit sales largely go away,
    thanks to a Trump administration plan to cancel fines for automakers that exceed
    fuel-efficiency goals.


    Investment research firm CFRA lowered its 12-month price target for Tesla shares

**2. Superposition Meets Production‚ÄîA Guide for AI Engineers**
_Date:_ July 17, 2025
_Key Finding:_ This newsletter delves into the current landscape and future prospects of quantum computing for AI applications, featuring insights from DeepMind veteran Jennifer Prendki. It highlights that while universal quantum computers are still some years away, specific quantum applications for machine learning are emerging today, particularly in recommendation systems, financial applications (e.g., fraud detection), and pharmaceuticals. A significant challenge is the lack of a mature "QMLOps" software layer, as the quantum computing stack is fragmented and primitive compared to classical ML infrastructure. The "no-cloning theorem" fundamentally alters data operations in quantum environments, requiring a shift to on-demand regeneration of quantum states rather than traditional backups or reproducibility. The newsletter also discusses how quantum computing enables new paradigms like Topological Data Analysis and emphasizes the need for "bridge talent" in engineering rather than deep quantum physics expertise for practitioners.
